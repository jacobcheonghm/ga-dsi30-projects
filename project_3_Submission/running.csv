running,"Hi

I bought a second hand treadmill (SS255 Orbit) which is an Australian model. I've downloaded the manual and read everything about it that I can but still can't find an answer to this. The Incline options, they go 4 - 8 - 12 and so on but I can't find anywhere to tell me if this corresponds to a % incline. So, does 4 on the incline = 4% incline?

Anyone with a Starstrider treadmill - can you enlighten me? I'm presuming the equate to percentages but would prefer to be sure.

running,"Hi! I’m a pretty new runner. I’m a little frustrated and just hoping for guidance from someone who knows more than I do. I started at the beginning of this year with the couch to 5k program. I took it way too fast and immediately got shin splints. I took a few weeks break, and then started back very slow, increasing my increments every two weeks instead of every week, and that seemed to do the trick. Finally, on my last week, I ran a full 5k. I will say I got a little too excited towards the end and upped my speed to faster than I’m used to for the last 5 minutes or so. 
The next day, my shins were a tiny bit irritated, but it wasn’t too painful, so I ran again, which was a mistake. The next day I woke up with shin splint pain again, and it’s now been 3 days I’ve been unable to run. 
My suspicion is that I pushed too hard, which is my fault. I’ve been resting and crosstraining, but my question is, how and when do I start back in? I’ve come to love running and I miss it already.

I'm not sure why I had a mental disconnent, but the marathon is obviously going to be outdoors where it'll be quite hot; the high will be ~94 degs with 0% chance of rain but maybe some cloud cover.

- wear long sleeves in a moisture-wicking material and with UPF. I can find lots of wicking shirts but most are short-sleeved and none have UPF.  The local Nike store is closed for a few more days for summer remodeling.  I could order some online if someone has a recommendation, but I'm a little leery given that I'm taller than average and I prefer to try stuff on.  

- wear a hat: moisture-wicking/cooling vs UPF? I just hit up my local stores (based on previous comments from this sub) and could only find one or the other, not both.  I bought one of each.  Does it really matter?  

- use one of those neck coolers.  I have one!  Check.  

- eat well in the days before, carry water, and have gels/bloks.  Check, check, and check.  Slow down if needed on race day.  Ok!  (Though I'm already preeeeetty slow.  Like, my goal here is 6 hours, hence why I'm worried the sun is going to be blasting for a good portion of my run.)  

- would it be dumb/ineffective to get one of those little around-the-neck fans?  I'm willing to look goofy if it works.  :D

running,"Hi All,

Long time peruser, first time poster. Looking for advise from what I’ve observed to be a fantastic community on here. 

Since late February I’ve been on a mission to try and get fit. 

Some brief context: I’m 31, from a relatively solid base of fitness in 2017 I’ve been on a slow, although not total, decline in fitness levels (brief periods of running in between). 

Most of my attempts to get fit since the start of this year have focused on running, treadmill and trail running; with some light weight training and core exercises interspersed. I made great progress in March and April, shedding weight and getting my 5k pace up. 

By the middle of May I was seconds off a personal best of 25 mins for a 5k. I felt great and was genuinely excited to get back out and try and get under the 25 mins… cue what’s been 2 months of hell.

The next trip to the gym I could barley get over 2k on the treadmill; it was like my body just gave in. I chalked it down to an off day and took the next day as rest day to give myself a break. But 2 months later I can’t get over it. My frequency of training hasn’t changed (2 days gym and 2/3 days of either 5-a-side football or a trail run) but my stamina has tanked. I really struggle to get over 3k at a 6 minuet pace without my body totally giving in, and if I do 5k I’ll have had to stop twice from periods to gather myself. 

It’s like the harder I work the worse I get. 

I tried a period of rest (about 6 days off). I’ve tried varying the intensity of my workout (slow longer distances and faster 2/3ks) but nothing works. 

Can anyone give me some advise? Is this normal?

My first mile is about and 8-8:30 pace, and my heart rate holds around 120-130.

running,"Hi!

I am running my first marathon on the 25th of September. I have been running for a long time, but not as seriously as i used to.

I am 19 years old (M) and i was around 16-17 when i really took running seriously! But i soon figured out i got a eating disorder from it, aswell as being almost controlled by it. So i stopped for a year and a half. But i occasionally still ran, because i was very good at it and the runners high is just something else.

My PB at different distances are:

1k (0.62 miles) - 2:50

5k (3.1 miles) - 17:59

10k (6.21 miles) - 40:48

Half Marathon - 1:30:29

Those are from the period where i was 16-17 years old. Now i obviously gained more muscle and weight (15 lbs) i train weights with a schedule saying: 3 days, rest day, 3 days rest day etc. Hitting all muscle groups. I do this in the morning and then run about 4 times a week, anywhere between 3-9 miles, in a tempo where i can talk to a friend while running. 

I recently did a 10k, as fast as i could and got it on 42 minutes, which is not bad considering i haven't taken it seriously for a while. 

I follow this program called the maffetone method, which i am trying out, because i do not want to focus on time or how much i weigh; because i know it will just lead to the same old mentality of always wanting to get lighter, faster, better time etc. 

So the bottom line is:

Am i ready for this marathon? I am not doing it, so I can get a good running time, I am doing it so i can get a slap across the face. It sounds weird, but i have been waaaay to comfortable the past 6 months and i need something that will either kick something in me or challenge me to the extreme.

This spring I felt it was time to try something new and decided I was gonna make it 15km this summer. I… just did that one day a couple of weeks ago. It was simply not a challenge, it just took me a little longer. And now I’ve ran 15km 6 times and today I made it 18.5km. So I’ve really just decided to make those 15km I had planned for the summer 21km instead, as that’s a neat distance to have ran. 

I’ve never ran a race in my life and this 21km thing is only because it’s fun. So I’m not asking for a lot of ‘advanced’ tips about training regimes or stuff like that. 

Just some simple tips, maybe? Some small things you guys, who are way more serious and knowledgeable than I am, feel can make a difference for you?

running,"Hello all. I'm a longtime Salomon user, which I've used in conjunction with my orthotics. I can use my orthotics in my trail, road and hiking shoes which is very convenient but also cost-effective from a student perspective. I've had a few Salomon pairs now and I'm happy so far, but my current pairs of Sense Ride 4 and Sonic Balance 3 are nearing the end of their lifetimes and so I have to start looking at options. 

I'm wondering whether I might just be stuck in a local minima with my current setup. If I want to move to say Hoka or something, I'm not just buying a new pair of shoes, but I would have to get new orthotics made for those shoes as well, which is quite expensive on a strained budget. So I kinda want to try something new which is hopefully better as well, but I don't know if it's worth the risk since what I have already works. If anyone has any relatable experiences or advice, please share!

For more context, I primarily run on decently technical trails and only get on the road when I need to. I have bad pronation and general sub-ideal running form, though the later is improving steadily. I've tried the firmer Ultra Pro shoes in the past which really didn't work for me, and the more cushioned Sense Ride 4 already made a huge difference. That's part of why I like the appeal of Hokas. If it really is worth getting different brands for road and trail then I'll consider it.

I find that without huge prep, i.e. a good breakfast, lots of hydration+electrolytes+running with a water source, i usually cap anywhere between 6-8miles and I am EXHAUSTED.   


Contrast with an easy 8 miles I did today on a treadmill with lackluster hydration and I still had a ton of energy left in the tank.

Is this harmful to me? 

Should I run up hill or downhill (I’m thinking of parts of the trail that are more steep than usual and are more difficult to walk up to)

running,"Any tips are appreciated. I've been reading and watching form videos, but I still feel like I'm doing something wrong and i don't know what. 

Basically I've been trying to improve my endurance this summer and doing a simple program where the goal is to be able to run for 30 min straight in 8 weeks or so. 

I've only been able to get up to 2 minutes of running before my front ankle area is burning and I can't go any longer. I'm getting so frustrated that i've been stuck at week 3 for weeks now and it's not improving. It's not pain in the sense of something feeling pulled, it's the same burning of if you're doing lunges and your thighs are burning, but it doesn't feel like it's getting better. 

It's not the same feeling as shin splints where you feel it all the way up to your knee, specifically in that muscle. I've gotten them in the past, but not at all since i've started this program. I'm not sore in the ankle area the next day, but it's burning enough during that I can't push through it longer than 2 min. I already feel like I'm going so slow that I'm practically running in place, but maybe I need to be even slower?

I got a 3D scan of my feet and new Asics from a running store but that's only helped minimally. I don't know what cues I should think of when running to try to fix this.

running,"Thanks in advance for any advice. I have a full marathon in the beginning of December. Followed by a full marathon in middle January. 

The first marathon is at a state park and on a trail. Additionally it is part of an ultra marathon. So I do not think there is a time cut off for the marathon race. Furthermore, I signed up for this run to run with some new running friends. Kind of like a sure I will run with you type of thing, as they are just getting back into the sport. But they are people I would like to build a relationship with. So I kind of want to do it with them. 

The second marathon is a normal on the street marathon with a six hour cut off and I really care about this one. I am close to finishing it ten times and really want the legacy status. 

About me I am 47 and in average shape. Ten years ago I would not even worry about doing the two but now that I am getting older I worry that might not finish the second. Last year I finish the second marathon just under five hours and would like to finish the second marathon under 5 hours again. Or perhaps even faster.   

My basic thoughts are treat the first marathon like a nice slow training run. Perhaps even just stop running at mile 21 and walk the last five. Then take two weeks off to let my body recover and then for following weeks do a longer run on the weekends of maybe 8, 10, 12 and then the full marathon.

running,"I (17M) used to be really in shape before the pandemic, and I'd accompany my dad to a lot of his running events, where I'd do the shorter events while he ran 21 or the full 42. Eventually I began to do the longer events as well even though I didnt really train, even a half marathon once.

As a fairly consistent, and relatively injury free runner I've seen/read/heard a lot of podcasts, videos, articles about the concept of ""junk miles"", ""running by feel vs. running by HR zones"", ""run slow to run fast""  ""MAF method"" and all what comes with it...

While doing my long runs, I feel like my HR climbs up a bit easier than what I've been reading about maintaining in the aerobic zone, but the problem with that is my 155bpm is 'comfortable' for me as a feel, which basically more compelled to run by feel.. Hence comes my gripe with the concept of ""junk miles"".. Does really running at the threshold of aerobic zone (around Z4) for a long run build up the junk miles and doesn't contribute to bettering performance..?

Then there is the other question: while maintaining a weekly workout to build anaerobic fitness (alongside S&amp;C) and be able to run faster for longer, I'm starting to think of the role of intervals/fartleks and other 'workout' runs in the overall running pace..

running,"I'm a 56year old running-n00b. I haven't done any excercise during the last 30-odd years other than the occasional sprint from the fridge to the couch in order to not miss the game.  
On advice of my GP I've taken up running a couple of weeks ago and it's not been a good start. I want to train for the Tilburg Ten Miles event in September and participate in the 5K-run.  
So, I searched for a good absolute beginners training programme. I don't really care about the time I achieve, as long as I don't finish last.   
I looked at the NHS Couch-to-5K programme, the Just Run Android app and my Garmin (Forerunner 55) watch has some exercise possibilities.   
I've began by trying the Just Run app and the Garmin Coaches but they all started off by making me run into an injury right off the bat. I had to stay 2 weeks off the training to allow my knees, shins and calf muscles to recover. All the time the Garmin ""coach"" kept moaning I shouldn't stop the training, which annoyed the heck out of me, so I stopped that.    
I decided to try create my own interval training using the Garmin watch app (Connect) workouts.

For the past week I successfully managed to complete an interval training of   
5' warming up + 5* [30"" run + 4'30"" (brisk) walk ] and 5' cooling down with a HR between 130 and 160.

The question I'm now having is: which is the best way to move forward with this training?  
I could increase the run-time and decrease the walk-time to get something like this:
warmup + 5* [45"" run + 4'15"" walk] + cooldown

or increase the frequency thusly:
warmup + 10* [ 30"" run + 2' walk ] + cooldown

I want to run my first half at Run Melbourne next week but I’m not sure how to plan my run:

* I’ve never taken nutrition or had water on a run before, I’m not sure if I should have some lollies in my pocket and eat them at specific times, or buy some gels or some other product? The opportunity is now gone to test these as the race is next weekend. 

* The other factor is the pace to run at. Today was about 5:00min/km for the full 15km and only needed to stop at traffic lights. I don’t know what I should be aiming for as I have no baseline.

running,"I’m 26M, 161 lb, 15% body fat.

After my daughter was born I let myself get way out of shape with all the new baby stress. About 10 months ago I decide to change that. I started running and lost 40 pounds to get into better shape than I had ever been in my life.

Honestly, I’ve never been that good of a runner, but I enjoy it. I remember practically passing out in high school gym class as I rounded out my first ever 7 minute mile. While my best friend did a sub 5. 

So it came as a bit of a surprise to me that after a few months of training at 26 and overweight, I could run a 7 minute mile again. And I didn’t stop there! About a week ago I ran my first ever sub 6 and felt pretty good.

So now I’m wondering how low I can reasonably go, especially since I still feel like I’m still improving.

For my routine: I get in about 3-4 miles every day with one 10k per week or two. I’ve been trying to increase my distance and quicken my pace: For the 3-4 miles I do a mix of faster 7:30/8 minute mile runs and slow runs to try to build an aerobic base.

My best 5k time was 21:32. I haven’t run a 10k seriously trying for speed but my fastest was at a leisurely 9 minute/mile pace and I could’ve gone faster.

I know I have the power to run at a 5 minute mile speed; I can do it for a quarter mile on the treadmill. But my aerobic system isn’t up to par with my legs and I’m way too out of breath to keep it up for longer.

running,"I am currently doing the couch to 5k routine because it's been forever since I ran. I'm doing it on a treadmill and most if not all of my training will be on a treadmill. My goal once I can run 2 miles nonstop with c25k is to run 2 miles a day 3 days per week on the treadmill and increase .1 mph per week. I'm doing the c25k at 5 mph, so after 7 or 8 weeks I should be running a 24 minute 2 mile on the treadmill. So basically every 10 weeks after that I'll have increased 1 mph. So post c25k it'll be 5.1-6.0 mph for 10 weeks increasing .1 mph per week. 6.1-7.0 mph for 10 weeks. 7.1-8.0 mph for 10 weeks. Then I'll start adding an incline for wind resistance (I read a study saying that the incline to offset wind resistance on treadmills below 8mph is completely negligible). So 8.1-9.0 in 10 weeks with a 1% incline. Then finally 9.1+ with 1% incline for however many weeks until I can run under 13 minutes. And I'll go from there. I'm looking at going from couch to 2 miles in under 13 minutes right at around a year.

I'm sure because I was in the army I would be able to increase my run time quicker if I were to focus just on running.

### Intro
I decided to do this 10K after being convinced by friends to join them doing it. I had only done 1 10K event before this therefore that was my target time in the hopes that over the last 2 months I've improved my pace and fitness. 

I was trying new shoes for the first proper tempo run today as well. I normally wear Brookes Ghost 14s but for my Birthday a few weeks ago I treated myself to a pair of Saucony Speed 2s. I've done treadmill work on them before to see if they were comfortable, but this would be the first race race in them. 

### Training
I'm currently training for my first half marathon and full marathon at the same time. Most of my training at the moment has been adding mileage to my training rather than any specific type of training at the moment. This includes doing 5K park runs and longer 10-15K runs at the gym to generally increase my fitness and form due to going from no running 4 months ago, to doing my first half marathon in 8 weeks from now. All my training is for enjoyment and to assist for the half marathon, not 5Ks and 10Ks. 

### Pre-race
This was my first race that started after midday! I was really unsure on what to do food wise, as normally i run on the morning at 9am and this race started at 7:20pm. I ended up just eating the same as I do normally but leaving my lunch to a bit later in the day so that I didn't have to then eat again before the race, or race hungry. 

There was a 5K happening at the same event which unfortunately meant the start for the 10K was delayed by 15minutes, by this point we were all already sandwiched in for the start so not much chance of being able to keep warmed up other than a few small stretches. 

I set my watch to my second target as I felt quite good for the race, 45min. Although this was my only 2nd paid event (other being another 10K which is where the 47min target came from), i felt a lot less nervous and my heart rate didn't start way to high before I even started! Delay didn't help, but I felt good!

### Race
### 1K
My first kilometer was very slow, this event was very varied in speeds and unfortunately myself and a few friends ended up out of position at the start so there was a lot of weaving through other people as safely as we could in the first 1K. 

### 2K
Due to the slow start, i was already 30seconds off my pacer for 45min. I therefore picked up the pace quickly, probably too quickly, to try and filter through the group which was a bit more spread out now, and to get back to that magic under target mark. 

### 3K
I feel I'm going way to fast here, but im now under my pacer, and I can see it getting lower! I was wondering if I could keep this pace up until the end, but it felt good so I stuck with it!

### 4K - 7K
Starting to feel the burn of the pace that I'm going at, I'm still overtaking a few people but the pace felt consistent. I could see i was still lowering my time to my pacer which I was surprised about, but luckily I knew I had a 2:30min buffer therefore if needed, i had time to spare. Water came at 6K, still cant drink it properly and it went straight to the lungs! but in the heat it was required!

### 8.3K
I say specifically 8.3K as although I looked at the route map before the race.... I could see the finish line and was surprised. No idea what was going through my head, but i was really tired, time to sprint!!! Oh wait.. no, this isn't the finish! there's a segregated area for that part! and due to the 5K being at the same time, the timer above the finish line was at the hour mark, super confusing! time to refocus for the last 1.7K

### 8.3K Onward
No idea what kept me going, but I made it to the finish and with a hill at the end it was brutal. Push to the finish!

### Post-race
I was exhausted, the volunteers were fantastic ice cold neck water and sports drinks available in the plenty. I finished just behind one of my friends somehow and we were able to chat about 30seconds after finishing without having to gasp for air every 2seconds! Time to wait for a another friend (finished at 50min) and to head to the pre-booked meal and strawberry daiquiri, we deserve it!

The new Speed 2s just absolutely wanted to propel me forward, and is probably part of the reason I was going so fast in 2.6K. Checked my strava afterwards, this is the fastest 10K i've ever done, and on top of that, it was so fast it was my fastest 5K time as well! and that is with doing weekly 5K speed runs at the park runs! Overall a great achievement and I'm so surprised and happy with the results!

As the title says. I have a MiFit band which syncs to Google fit, but I also have an arm strap so I can take my phone on runs. I want accurate data as it helps with my motivation.

My feeling is Google Fit as that was on my phone and using GPS, it knew where I had been and plotted on the map. Has anyone got any ideas why the two devices would be so off from each other though... it's almost twice as much! It's important too as this means I have been running a lot more than I thought as I usually go on runs with just the watch and no phone. Many thanks.

running,"So I’ve been using NRC lately to train for a 10k while also using WorkOutDoors to track my runs and upload to Strava. What I’m starting to notice is there seems to be a discrepancy between the two apps in terms of most stats.

Any time I don’t look at my watch for a minute the nrc app will say “connection to phone lost” but then pick up presumably where it should be. Same for work out doors, if I look at the watch after a couple minutes the pace will be way high (like 24min/mi) but then drop back to normal. Is there a way to smooth this out at all. Also today I did a steady 25min recovery run and I got 2.38mi at 10:30pace on NRC and on WorkOutDoors it was 2.58mi at 9:42pace(which also got uploaded to Strava w/different stats)

Question is, am I unfit? I do this particular route all the time but it felt hard tonight. The route was fairly flat with a few hilly bits in between.

5:22 miles distance.
47 minutes time taken.
9:05/ mi average pace.
Average heart rate 158bpm.

 I have had a recent train regime change in the gym focusing more on strength and weights and to be honest, I've probably neglected cardio.

running,"So I’ve been running casually for years, never over 5k. I recently started to seriously train towards a half marathon. I’ve always just carried my phone in hand but cause my runs are getting longer I thought I’d get shorts to carry them better. Yesterday I ran without my phone in my hand for the first time and before I could get to a mile my left lower back, right above my hip hurt like crazy. I thought it was just a tweak so I stopped, but today I was going to run my first 10k and it started to hurt same exact spot. I got to about mile 3 when I had to stop, it’s not a sharp pain or anything, it’s like this very sore feeling nagging pain, and when I stopped it felt like my whole left leg was asleep.

running,"Hey y'all! Came to a realization and am just curious to know your thoughts on this, if you agree etc. Just a disclaimer this post is purely anecdotal as well and not backed up by any research, nor am I claiming any part of this to be objective fact. 

Anyways, let me start by saying a bit about myself! I've been running track &amp; field since 7th grade and cross country since 9th grade and I'd like to think I came into the sport swinging 😅 by the end of my 7th grade season, I dropped my 1600m time to 5:24; by 8th grade, it was 5:04. Finally my sophomore year, I went sub-5 and ended the season with a 4:37 mile at my conference championship race. My junior and senior seasons were both canceled due to covid, so I ended up not running another track race until last year, my freshman year of college (more on that soon 😛).

In cross country, I surprised myself by going sub-19 in the 5K by the end of my first season. I then followed that with sub-18 my sophomore year, sub 17 my junior year (and qualification for state championships!! first one in 18 years from my high school to go to states), and an 8 second PR my senior year, dropping my 5K time to a 16:47, but missing states due to covid limiting the number of qualifiers. My junior year, I got in contact with and was recruited by the coaches at the University of New Haven and began my collegiate running career with them last fall! 

I decided to start making waves early on. I'm a fierce competitor, excel at racing and one thing about me, I hate status quo bullshit. When people want to sit pretty in their positions, I can't help but want to wipe the smirks off their faces. So I came in swinging. Spent the entirety of my XC season making headlines in my school paper, placing 1st for our team in every race, getting a top 5 finish my first ever college XC race (running my current 8K PR of 26:24), and grabbing the highest individual Conference and Regional placements by a freshman in our program's history. I continued to make program history in my first EVER Indoor season (I only had outdoor in high school) by being the first person in program history to qualify for both the 3K and 5K Conference championships during the same season. Fast forward to Outdoor season and, though I underperformed at Conference due to having the flu, I walked away from my freshman year with PRs in every event I've ever run! This post is starting to get long and I haven't even gotten to the point, so just take this list of my PRs: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1udmMwjaqJir2PmBldzMS5SCQI796YDu4n-AY8_EdlLY/edit?usp=drivesdk

Now, to the point! Measuring pace in miles vs kilometers, and the psychology of it all. Let me start by saying I'm very obviously aware that 1km is shorter than 1mi, however I still believe it's very valid to compare the 2 as units of measuring pace during a run/race. Up until sometime this year, I've only ever measured pace using the mile. Even if I was running a race that didn't have exact mileage (i.e. a 5K being 3.1 instead of just 3mi) I'd think to myself ""okay I need to run [insert mile pace here]"" and sometimes I'd even pace myself to the half mile. Then I ran an 8K. I didn't think much of pace at all my first race since I had never run an 8K before, but when I first saw that I had run it at 5:18/mi pace my jaw dropped- I couldn't believe I had run nearly 5 miles at that pace (and at the time, I actually had PR'd in the 5K during the 8K). 

**As my times got faster and faster, it became discouraging seeing the kind of mile pace I'd have to run to hit my next goals.** I'd never give up or not try as hard because I think I can't do it, but for example seeing that I'd have to run 5:06/mi pace to run my XC goal time was just.. nerve-racking. I'd push myself harder and harder but it just always seemed to be out of reach. My first race last XC season was my best; I never even really came close to beating 26:24 (I will cut myself *some* slack in saying the 1st meet was held on Long Island so it was completely flat, literally a 20 foot elevation gain at best).

**Introducing: 1K pacing!** I'd never done a 1K in high school, not even in workouts, so my first time running a 1K as a workout rep was last year. As I became more and more familiar with the 1K, and how fast I can run it in workouts and races, I've grown to love it more than miles as an indicator of pace. Continuing the example of my goal 8K time, in which I'd have to run 5:06/mile pace, it translates to about 3:10 per 1K. Though I know these are both the same pace, as 1K is just 600m short of 1mi, telling myself ""just run a 3:10 8 times"" just feels better to me, as I've run 3:10 many times before (and even faster than that) in workouts and races, and it feels much more familiar to me than a 5:06 mile. 

**Mind Games 101: Beating Your Own Mind.** When my mind tells me I can't run a 5:06 mile, I simply say ""okay, but I CAN run a 3:10 1K."" When my mind waged psychological warfare on itself, I found a way to combat it. Now, as my sophomore cross country season rapidly approaches, I look to my 3:10/1K pace and say ""game on.""

running,"I have bad form! Just found out a couple weeks ago. I’m 41/F and do 25-30 miles per week. Was hoping to do a fall half marathon. 

After adding speed and hill training to my training for about 6 months, I got no increase in pace. So I filmed myself and learned I was an overstrider, heel striker, and bounder, all with a 155 cadence and axe chopping arms. Looks p silly. 

Read stuff that suggested hitting the right cadence would likely fix many components of poor form. I ran 60-ish cadence focused miles with a metronome alternating w 170 bpm music. Now my cadence is in the “correct” range. Filmed myself again and saw that now I’m sort of prancing. Still overreacting on stride but landing midfoot. Bounding height has increased.

Turns out I was a heel striker with slow cadence (155) and brought my arms too far up and had some bounding. That explains a lot, ok. 

So I do some research on fixing these things and find some stuff that says if you fix cadence, everything else often falls into place. Fast forward about 60 miles of serious cadence practice, my cadence is up to 165-170. But I filmed again in and I’m now prancing. Still overstriding but landing on my mid foot instead of the heel.

I've been running for about two years now, and for the past year or so I've been averaging 15-20 km per week. I've signed up for a half marathon in mid-September, and I've been increasing my weekly mileage for the past couple months for training. My typical week will include a 5-7k easy run, a 5k fast run or interval training, and then a long run on the weekend (slowly increasing mileage and did my first 21.1k two weeks ago).

Last week I did a 15k long run on the weekend and about half way through I started feeling some pain on the outside of my right knee, sometimes extending into my hip. Did some reading and it sounds like it could be my IT band.

I took a few days off and also replaced my shoes (they seemed ok, but had a lot of miles on them so they were probably well past due to replace). Last night I tried a 10k run with the new shoes. My knee felt ok during the run (feet were a bit sore, still breaking in the new shoes). But as soon as I stopped, I felt that same pain on the outside of my knee, and it was quite sharp to the point I had difficulty even walking through it.

So I'm looking for some advice on what I should do next. If I wasn't training for the half marathon I'd just take a month or two off from running, but I don't want to set myself that far back.

running,"Hello!

I’m returning to running after such a  long time away that I’m considering myself a new runner. I’m a 33M, 5’9” 146lb and consider myself relatively fit. I workout 3-5 days a week, and up until now that has been a mix of cycling interval training on an indoor trainer, strength training using compound barbell lifts, and long outdoor bike rides on the weekend with my partner. Now, I have the running bug after we did some daily miles while on vacation and away from our normal routines. Now I want running to be my primary focus for training, but I do not want to give up my other exercises. My running goals are consistency and building up weekly miles. I’m not concerned with speed- I’m typically right around 10mpm. 

The strength training is important because 1) I’ve had a meniscectomy in one knee and want to ensure I’m always keeping the surrounding system strong 2) I paid for a year membership and don’t wanna waste the money 😂. I’m okay to keep the cycling training lighter, I mainly want to maintain my modest bike fitness (190 FTP, 2.9/wKg) so I can do some long joy rides on the weekends. I don’t do group rides or have any interest in racing on the bike etc. All of this is to say, I’m not 100% sure how to balance this all. I built a routine that looks great on paper, but not sure it’s a good approach-

Monday - 2mi treadmill run, strength training (30 min) AM; cycling zone 2 ride (1 hour) PM
Tuesday - 2-3mi outdoor evening run
Wednesday- 2mi treadmill run, strength training (30 min) AM; cycling intervals (1 hour) PM
Thursday- 2-3mi outdoor evening run
Friday - rest
Saturday/Sunday - long ride outside and rest, or 2-3 miles run outside or rest

I’ve followed this so far this week, but noticed that yesterday on any outdoor 3mi run (85F and humid fwiw) my HR was very high for the perceived effort. I was running at a conversational pace (10:10mpm) but my (new) Garmin forerunner had [nearly my entire run in Z4 and Z5.](https://imgur.com/a/Y3mvXZT) My understanding is there’s no way Z4 and Z5 can be conversational. For reference, a hard interval workout in the bike has my [HR reach up into Z4 and a touch of Z5 but is predominantly Z2](https://imgur.com/a/RFo1HsZ) (though I train my power not HR on the bike). 

My questions are- is it possible my HR zones are inaccurate, which is why there’s a big discrepancy between my perception and the zones on my watch?

Does anyone else here balance running as a primary exercise with strength training and cycling and if so, how do you do it?

Was my HR increased on Thursday due to fatigue from Wednesdays workout? 

Do I just need to run even slower than I thought and train by HR zone right now?

running,"I am very excited, I have my first marathon coming up in 8 days in Ha Long Bay, Vietnam.  I have a few questions for the group that I listed below. 

1. Salt consumption- I have been taking 1 salt tablet (similar to fast food restaurants) every hour or so during training.  On race day should I bring 4 tablets with me, or is it only recommended to take one or two max or am I taking less than I should?
2. Race time- So in Vietnam the heat is a real bitch.  At the beginning of my training I was running right around a 4 hour pace, but the past month or so as the heat has cranked up my time has slipped a bit closer to a pace of 4:15-4:30.  I really want to achieve a goal of under 4 hours.  The location that I am running in is a less humid and around 3-5C cooler than where I have been training.  Is there anything wrong with pushing myself to hit that sub 4 hour goal? 
3. Nutrition- I don't eat very often when running are GU-rockutane gels enough? If not, what does everyone recommend carrying with during the run?

Thanks in advance.",First Marathon Questions
running,"Hello, 

so I have only been runnning for a couple of years with a rather long off period in the beginning of the year. My first race is in September and I have started training for it. in May. I do my easy runs at about 10-10:30 pace. That is the pace I know I can hold for 10 miles, but I also cannot see how I could run 10 miles at a faster pace just now. 

So for the half I imagine that I will be running the 13.1 Miles at exactly my easy pace. I don't understand how I would be able to run that faster if I have never ran that in training, so I guess can I expect to run any faster in the race itself just because there is a race setting?

### Training
I didn't really do anything particular, I knew weather in July would be rough and I wasn't looking at a PR. A month beforehand I was managing a good 20mpw, but a few weeks prior my training tailed off drastically as the weather got hotter and more humid. I ran 3mi at tempo a few days prior and my goal honestly is to just finish the race. I did a 10k PR of sub-54 but I don't think I'll be able to hit that in this heat. 

### Pre-race
Weather update the day before said humidity was at 96% and temperature at 80F. Looks like I'm not getting a PR, will run at a ""party pace"" and honestly just enjoy my first race. 

I woke up around 6am, used the restroom, got dressed, downed a Gatorade, and ate a banana and some cinnamon toast crunch. I really wanted to run on an empty stomach because it gets pretty upset, but I'm glad I got some food down pre-race. My dad drove me down to the start point, probably a good decision as I wouldn't have to worry about parking and takihg the metro before the race. The crowds were massive. I used the porta potties one last time and made my way towards the corrals. 

I regret choosing wave L (10:30/mi pace), it meant I had to wait another 30 min to start and also weaving through walkers. I decided to do some active stretching and only made my way towards my wave a few minutes before the gun. 

### Mile 1
Luckily I made my way towards the front of the wave, and didn't have to weave around too many people. Surprisingly I started at an 8:30/mi pace, a lot quicker than I expected. First 3 miles were downhill then two pretty decent hills so I knew I should pace myself better. It was hard keeping a 9:00 pace and seeing people pass me. I also thought I could run without music but after turning the first corner, spectators were gone and it got quiet. I quickly jammed my airpods in. 

### Mile 2
Still tried to keep a 9:00/mi pace, I could probably go faster but my goal at the end is honestly to sub-hour. I was having a lot of fun, hooted and hollered at the spectators, gave high fives, and smiled at the photographers. I'll try to enjoy this race as much as possible since the atmosphere was amazing. 

### Mile 3
Started getting a little more serious now, lots of downhill but I know the hills were coming. The sun came out and started getting more hot, I tried my best to run into the mist sprays scattered throughout the track. I decided not to get water yet. I didn't realize how much energy it took weaving through people, I regret not getting an earlier corral. 

### Mile 4
The hills quickly started before the halfway mark. Is this the dreaded cardiac hill? What made it worse were all the walkers taking most of the road, I decided to follow some runners to the side along the escape/emergency lane. I made it over the first hill fine at a 9:30-10:00/mi pace, but I completely didn't expect another hill immediately after. A spectator told me after the first hill that it was all downhill from here, something I regret believing. It caught me by surprise and I think this was the real cardiac hill. Dodging walkers was troublesome, I had to beeline to the sidewalk to find a clear path up. Passing by a hospital/medical facility I knew the worst has passed. My right knee started aching. 

### Mile 5
At this point I hit a pretty hard wall and started getting nauseous. My HR was pushing 200BPM and my body was telling to walk but wanted to push through. Passing by a water station I wanted to splash water over my head, but it went down all my back and soaked my shorts. Great. We passed the i85 bridge and was nearing 16th street. Counting down to 10th street was so painful, but was the only thing keeping me sane. My left hip started hurting, so I decided to walk through the next water station. Two shirtless guys were keeping pace with me so I decided to tag along with them to the finish.

### Mile 6
I don't remember much of the last half mile. After rounding the corner on 10th, I slowly began picking up my pace. I knew I couldn't full out sprint or else I would throw up, so I tried my best to speed up gradually while dry wheezing. Luckily dodging people wasn't too difficult and there was a lane on the left side for runners to pass. Smiled at the cameras and made it through sub hour!

### Post-race
It was pretty rough cooling down but all I can remember was how amazing the peach and the water they handed out tasted post-race. It was probably the best georgia peach I've eaten, crisp, cold, tart, and sweet at the same time. I'll probably keep signing up for this race just for the peach. After the nausea passed, a rush of adrenaline surged through me. Even though I hated the humidity, didn't PR, and struggled through the hills, I loved the energy of the crowd, spectators, and rush of the race, and want to sign up for a more serious event in the fall (probably the 10-miler and half)! It was a good intro into racing and I've learned some lessons with aid stations, hydration, etc and can't wait to race again!

running,"Hi all,

Bit of backstory….Been running for some years, took a break and returned this year using my old Altra Escalante 1.5 and Altra Lone Peak 4.5, both pairs around 5 years old, unsure of the mileage but fairly high..

Fast forward to a few weeks back when I got some Hoka Clifton 8 and SpeedGoat 5 that I’d tested as much as possible in a running store. 

I couldn’t get Altra anywhere other than overseas and different versions in the past have sized different so I was worried they wouldn’t fit.

Anyway, the shoes feel comfortable, I really like the cushion feel towards the front as I run on the mid - front of my feet rather than heel strike and they’re a 5mm drop so not a huge jump from zero and possibly irrelevant if I land on my forefoot anyway?

My only complaint is my feet seem to get much hotter in these, and specifically on the balls of me feet, to the point I’m worried I may get a blister (I haven’t yet, longest run is only around 7 miles) 

Anyone tried both and able to confirm one brand just breaths Better? 

Could it be the lack of foot shape at the front? My feet don’t feel squashed, one pair is Wide, the other Extra wide and no rubbing on the sides that I’m aware of.

Extra cushion allowing my feet to move inside the shoe more creating friction maybe?

Transition period that might pass, do Hokas generally need a little run in time? 

It’s winter here for reference, this mornings run 6c / 43f, I use the lace lock technique on my shoes to try to keep my feet still and have done on the new Hokas too. 


Welcome any insight and suggestions, I’d like to continue with the Hokas if I can as they’re not causing me issues other than the heat, and they’re expensive so it’s gonna hurt if I have to but Altras again right now, but ultimately if these are never going to work then that’s what’ll happen I guess.

So, I'm a relatively newer runner, and I decided this year to get more into it and train for a 10k. I've been running 2-4  times a week doing a 5k training series I found on my nordictrack x22i before I start the 10k series, and have been seeing noticeable improvements (I can run for longer without needing to pause. Unless I have to run on an incline. Kills me everytime)

 But anyway a couple of weeks ago I took about a week and a half off from training due to feeling under the weather (I think it was a covid long hauler flair-up, based on my prior experiences with it and my symptoms, but I'm not sure.) But since getting back on the training wagon, it hasn't been going great.

During the runs I've done since getting back at it, my heart has been hanging out in peak zone a lot longer than it usually does, and then takes a few hours after to calm down below 100-110 bpm. Hell, my run yesterday was about 30 minutes spent in peak, with only 15 minutes in cardio. And today I still feel pretty run down.

running,"I have a flexible schedule and could run anytime of the day. But I specifically wait until around 8pm so I can avoid sun damage and the need to put on sunscreen, sunglasses, and a hat.

running,"Hi all, I've recently been experimenting with restricting my ""eating window"" (I try to eat between noon and 8 pm). I'd been running right before lunch but it's finally just gotten too hot and so now I've started running in the mornings.

I'm just curious what the science says about meal timing after a run. I know recent studies have sort of upturned advice like ""eat protein"" immediately after weight training. Seems like the current scientific consensus is you eat protein hours after weight training and still gain muscle.

How about endurance activities like running? Is it necessary to try to restore your glycogen soon after a run? Or can you wait 3 hours or so before having a post workout meal? A typical run for me is about 6 miles (trail run), in about 50 minutes.

running,"Several months ago, there was a thread on this forum asking how running had changed people's lives. I was a bit late to the party, but I posted the story of how running helped me through cancer, and a few people seemed to find it meaningful. Today, on the two-year anniversary of my breast cancer diagnosis, I thought I'd share it more widely. Maybe someone needs to hear it today. I would love to hear others' stories of how running has impacted your life in the comments.

I'd been a runner off and on since my twenties, but started running again consistently a few years ago in my mid-thirties, shortly before getting a life-altering diagnosis of a cancer-causing genetic mutation. My genetic mutation causes an extremely high lifetime risk of stomach cancer that generally can't be caught on screenings, as well as a roughly 50% lifetime risk of breast cancer.

The recommendation was to have my entire stomach removed to prevent cancer. It was terrifying, so I ran and ran and ran, right up until the day before my surgery. It felt like the only time I had any peace from my thoughts.

It can be hard to keep weight on with no stomach, so post-surgery, one of my major goals was to prove to my medical team that I could eat enough to fuel my running habit. I did so, and started running again just a little bit over 2 months after my surgery. At the time, I was still working through my feelings about the fact that they found stage 1 stomach cancer when they did the pathology on my stomach (as they do for most people with my genetic mutation) and runs were a great time to process that.

Then, in the summer of 2020, I was diagnosed with breast cancer. That was also terrifying, so I ran and ran and ran for my mental health. In those awful few weeks between my diagnosis and my surgery, running was the only time that I could forget that I was carrying around this little invader in my body that wanted to kill me. I think I shocked the physician's assistant when, at my two week follow-up after surgery, I was already begging for (and got!) clearance to run. 

When I started chemo, I made a point of running a few miles every other day. It was far less than I was used to, but I credit running as the reason why I had a pretty easy go of it, dodging many of the side effects and never experiencing ""chemo brain.""

Prior to each chemo infusion, they would huge doses of steroids to prevent my body from rejecting the chemo drugs. The steroids made me jittery and antsy and sleepless, so it was not unusual to find me out for pre-dawn runs the day after chemo, trying to wear myself out enough to sleep. And hey! It worked. Good times.

Now, I celebrate each post-cancer milestone with long, joyful runs. I just got back from a ten miler.

I’m all endurance so I started off about 6 weeks ago with 5ks and have been (very slowly) breezing through them and it’s been going well. I built up my mileage and started adding a 10k every couple days into the mix.

I’ve run about the equivalent of about a 5K the past three days. (2.5ish miles, 4.5 miles, 3.75 miles) but haven’t been focusing on time really.

I spent the last 2 months in a walking boot on my left foot.

I started to develop some minor back of knee/low hamstring pain in my right knee a couple of weeks ago. Last week, I was in bed sitting upright and I pulled my right leg into my chest so I could scratch my toe. When I pulled my leg in I heard loud crunching and cracking. It was unsettling to say the least. The next morning, and since, I’ve been feeling pain on the inside of my knee, behind my knee, and on the inside of my thigh. Thankfully I’m wfh so I’m able to ice it 4-5x a day, but I’m concerned that the pain isn’t improving one week later, despite staying off of it. Since no ‘injury’ occurred, I thought this would take a few days to recover from. I can hardly walk around the house if I’m not wearing a brace.

Has anyone ever experienced this? Nothing happened! I don’t get it!!

I'm taking it very slow, I struggle to run more than one lap of a nearby park, so I follow a pattern that's both comfortable enough and pushes my ability - one lap run, one lap walk, one lap run, one lap walk, half a lap run and half a lap sprint, two-three laps walk repeatedly. 

Now as I've read its common experiencing shin splints, specially if you don't warm up. But those subside within the first 2-3 laps.
I can't find the persons name now, but I had found a warm up routine on here and I feel it's helped a lot. 

However, including today my last 3 runs have been extremely painful and even cut short because I felt I was just putting myself in harms way :/ I looked up the exact muscle it is (I think) the Gastrocnemius or basically 'just under the calf on the inside of the leg'.
It felt like almost the bone but I think it makes sense it's the muscle.

It feels like the opposite of a shin splint :/ If s.s. subsides within a couple of laps, this shite just flares up the more I run, even if take walking breaks or stop for 5-10min altogether.

I realise that running form can affect the performance and injuries a lot, so I'm probably gonna bring a friend next time with me, help me record it and figure out if that's the case. 
Also, as a friend so lovingly yet potentially accurately pointed out, I'm 185cm (around 5'11 - 6'0) 20yo and weigh about 90-95kg. I live in India, and it's 35-40°c here (even mornings at 6a.m.) 
Maybe I'm just overthinking and this pain is just an early stage heavy boi runner thing. 

Anyway, I apologise for the long post. I also wanted to Thank the community for the unbelievable supportive attitude on here that helped me escape the mind block of 'people' anxiety and all the helpful tips.

running,"Hi everyone, hoping to input crafting a plan. I've read a lot of posts and tried to put together a more formal plan for myself. Thanks in advance!

***Background***

To date I've been a casual runner, running 3x/week, 10mpw, roughly 8:30/mile, 5:20/km

I can maintain that 8:30/mile pace over 5k, where afterwards I feel tired but not exhausted (from my understanding perhaps this is just a tad faster than a standard ""tempo"" pace?). Trying to maintain 8:00/mile over 5k takes a lot of mental exertion and gasses me.

Occasionally I do a very mild dirt trail run for \~1hr, \~5 miles. The trail really is quite mild. 5mph is from my understanding roughly what my ""easy"" pace should be, though Idk if the mild hilliness disqualifies this as an ""easy"" VO2 run.

***TL;DR, goals and questions:***

* I don't have a timeline for aggressively chasing any speed targets. I just want to have fun while putting in some rigor to make sure I'm steadily improving.
* plan: first increase mileage to roughly 4\~5hr total run time, 20\~25mpw
   * what's the best way to distribute this over the days? Is it better to do more frequency, e.g. padding some easy runs, or to run fewer times/week, but with a few longer runs?
* Not a dedicated runner, so not looking to go beyond 4-5hrs of running/week. How much faster can I expect to get on 4-5 hours of runtime/week?
   * how quickly should I aim to decrease my 5k pace, given that I'm starting at a modest 5:20/km? is  (5seconds/km/month) too aggressive? too modest?
* can an easy/mild trail run work work for my easy miles?
   * I live in the city and really don't enjoy running on city streets nor treadmills, and no large parks nearby, hence why I prefer trail and would like to keep treadmill sessions to shorter sessions. I have a local trail that has convenient segments: a 2.5 mile mild loop, 1mile intermediate loop, 0.5mi quite steep loop so I can fine-tune distances fairly easily.

Thanks in advance!

=====

***My eventual target plan: 5x/week, 20-25 miles, gradually phase this in over 10 weeks*** **(i.e. \~10% mileage increase per week), calibrated to my current vdot speed**

* 1x long easy pace treadmill, \~1hr
* 1x interval day (6x8 or 10x4) + easy before/after
* 2x long easy pace trail, \~1hrs
* 1x 30-min tempo run, sandwiched with warmup and cooldown

**Subsequently:**

* gradually ratchet up vdot/speed

**Any other ways to think about this?** 

* Make the easy trail run into a faster/more intense workout? 
* Take out the intervals? 
* Is increasing frequency more important? perhaps with more shorter easy runs? (e.g. go up to 6x/week)
* Or is a longer trail run better? (I think I would enjoy this more)",questions on crafting 5k training plan on limited running time
running,"Hi! Hope ya’ll are having a great summer!

Here today to share with you my history of struggling with LEG CRAMPS. First, here's a little bit about me. I'm 35 years old and have been running for 5 years. I’ve run 5 marathons and currently training hard to get a sub 3.5 this year.

Ok, here’s the story of my struggle with leg cramps. For the first 2 years of my running, more than half of my races (over a half marathon) I would get cramps in my calves midway through the race, which would affect my pace, A LOT. For half marathons it happens around 11 miles, and for marathons around 18-22 miles, like a CURSE. There were times when the cramps were so bad that I had to quit the race, and there is nothing more frustrating than having months of hard work end this way.

There are many different opinions on the internet about the causes and solutions for leg cramps in endurance sports, such as overtraining, form, leg fatigue, electrolyte loss, etc. I believe they all have their nice points and everyone should just keep trying with their own situation, or consult a professional to know what works for them. Here, though, I'll share the very useful and not-so-effective methods I've tried, so feel free to discuss!

First of all, the methods that were not very useful for me (and here I want to emphasize):

1. Taking BCAAs and potassium before the race, and a herbal tea called [peony licorice tea](https://www.rxlist.com/peony/supplements.htm). Some friends had highly recommended this to me, too bad it didn’t work.

2. Compression tights and taping. I'm sure these products work for some runners, but unfortunately not for me.
3. Pickle juice. I'm curious if any runners have gained from it? :)

Next are the methods that worked for me:

1.  Adjustment of running form. I tried to run with the big muscles behind my hips instead of my calves. Don't run with just your knees, but with a big kick backwards. Imagine there are gears in your pelvis and rotate your legs. It was tough at first, but as I continued to practice by extending the distance by 1 km, my landing became a natural flat landing and my calf muscles were not that tired.

2. Adjustment of my training program. In particular, my leg cramps improved a lot after I increased the weight of my strength training.

3. Magnesium and [Katsuo Stamina](https://www.staminasports.com). These are 2 completely different supplements. I tried them separately and found them both to be very effective. Right now I'm used to taking magnesium as a daily supplement (I use the powdered one and put it in orange juice, because I don't really like the taste of magnesium). I only use Katsuo Stamina for the tougher workouts and races.

4. Rest and sleep. This one seems the most basic, but it's actually the hardest! Even if you want to keep training for a newer PR, please don't forget to let your body and mind relax from time to time. Finding new interests and spending meaningful time with people you love is often easier when you are no longer overly obsessed with one goal. This worked for me!

running,"For the past 6 months, I have been slowly increasing my mileage and improving my fitness for my upcoming high school XC season. I used to run 25-35 miles a week during and before my winter track season but have now brought that up to about 45-50 m a week. I generally do 4  days of easy runs, 2 workout runs (one on the track the other one done as a tempo, hills, fartlek, etc.) , and one ""crosstraining (I bike)/active rest/an extra workout day. 

Over the months my times during my workouts and easy runs have been steadily improving: Let's say in a 6x800m workout I could hit 2:35s consistently when I used to struggle to hit 2:45s. In my easy runs, my average mile splits improved from around 7:40pace to 7:10 pace while still feeling relatively ""easy"". 

However, for the past week or 2, I cannot manage to hit my usual times during my workouts(sometimes being 10 or even 15 seconds off), almost like I am going back to when I was out of shape even though I am giving it everything I got. This definitely takes a toll on my mental and have been less motivated or even slightly anxious on workout days. This tends to be more notable in the longer rep workouts like 800,1000 and the mile repeats. Interestingly though, My ""easyruns"" splits haven't changed much (albeit feeling slightly less easy but definitely not hard) and my shorter rep workouts like the 400m haven't been affected much either(still hitting consistent 75s).

I have come up with a couple of potential reasons I could think of that is affecting my performance

1. **I haven't taken a ""proper"" break from running.** I basically run track year-round. Winter is for winter track, spring is for spring track, Summer is for training like sh#t, and fall is for XC. I haven't actually taken 1 week or 2 off this year and have pretty much been running all the time week after week.
2. **Mental burnout.** As I said I have been increasing my mileage and my workouts have gotten progressively harder. In addition to that, I usually train with my friends but during the summer I train on my own which makes workouts 2or 3 times harder (no joke). 
3. **Working out on the track.** In my opinion, the track is the best and worst place to do workouts on. Let me explain: It is very good as one lap is 400m, so it is very consistent and you can get precise times of your reps + added bonus because the material is rubber it is better on the feet. **BUT,** but, but, but, It makes the workout boring as you are just running around the same place even when I add variation into my workouts and IT MAKES IT SO DAMN EASY TO QUIT ON YOUR WORKOUTS... Take an 800m rep, for example, the first 400m is so hard to begin with, and by the time you do the first lap you can so easily say ""frick this I can't do this anymore"" when deep down you know you could have finished it. I have to keep telling myself ""you run past that 400m mark, and the hardest part is over"". Its a dumb idea, I know, but man I wish straight tracks were a thing that makes it ambiguous where the 400m mark is. 
4. **I recently moved houses and haven't been getting good sleep.** I have a disability where my bladder is naturally just small,(yes, I have seen a doctor, yes, I have tried medications) and I mean small, small. During school, I would have to go to the bathroom after every single period. Therefore, I end up having to wake up 3,4,5,6 times every night to go to the bathroom. hence, my sleep is interrupted and I get overall bad quality sleep, and sleep just feels like I hit the pause button last night and hit the play button the next morning without anything in between(basically not restful at all). Combine that with the fact that I just moved to a new house, a new environment to sleep in, my sleep is pretty much dog poop.
5. **Nutrition.** I am definitely on the ""skinny/lean"" side weighing about 119lb while 5""9. As I run close to 50m a week, my easy runs are around 9 or 10 miles and I average around 19,000 steps a day, meaning I burn a lot of calories. Therefore, I have consciously started eating more than I used to and am now probably eating 2,400 - 2800 calories depending on my activity level that day (can't give an exact number as I don't track calories from my fruits and veggies that seriously). I have been maintaining my weight and my goal of ""main-gaining"" seems to be working but if I wake up tired and feel tired during my warm-ups, should I be eating more?
6. **Not enough cross-training.** I guess this kind of ties into ""not taking a break"" but I don't have weights easily available (especially as school is closed now) so I pretty much do little to no weight training. I have tried body weight exercises but I feel like there isn't much benefit as my legs are already used to carrying my weight around, even on one foot, like the piston squats. I mostly just bike but I don't bike a whole lot, maybe 10-15 miles a week and I feel like biking uses a lot of the similar muscles used in running so even biking could feel tiring after a hard workout day. Should I be cross-training more? do you guys have any suggestions for cross-training that requires little equipment?

I would love to use one of the Garmin plans to run 10k but they just don't provide audio feedback like my AW does while using the MapMyFitness app (it tells me when cadence is low and how I'm doing) I would love to have that in my Garmin but it just doesn't do it (or I'm not using it correctly)...

With this said...which watch would be a good ""first buy"" from Garmin that can provide the access to plans and audio feedback via only the watch and my beats?

TIA!",Best Garmin for a starting 10k runner?

Got me to click to the site and least where the rules do explicitly forbid men.  No reason is given.  In a section asking if children are allowed to do the event the answer is yes, but only girls.  Boys are not allowed to participate in any way.  Volunteers even must be women by the looks of it.  It appears that men are allowed to spectate but that's it.  It seemed very weird to me.  There is a huge emphasis on being a ""princess"" on the site.  I feel like a similar race that was all about hyper-masculinity and excluded women would be seen pretty negatively.

running,"So here's my dilemma, I'm currently in the middle of the C210K running plan and I'm hitting an issue where during my longer runs, I have to make the decision between trying to stay in a Zone 1 HR or trying to meet my time hacks (for example 2sets x 15 mins). I'm not fit enough to maintain a sub &lt;156 HR while also meeting the time goal for the scheduled week. So, here are my apparent options:

1. Try to maintain the Zone 1 HR and fail to hit the time hack (meaning I have to walk during those 15 mins). My personal rule is that if I have to walk 3+ times in one set then I ""fail"" the set, and thus fail the run for that scheduled day and repeat it on the next running day.
2. Run to meet the time hack, and try to keep my HR as close to Zone 1 as possible (but not focusing on it) without sacrificing a ""fail"" for the set. After my sets are done, any additional distance I put down will allow walking to stay within a Zone 1 HR.
3. Create a hybrid of the two other options in which I ignore the number of times that I walk during a set which will allow me to keep my HR in Zone 1, and still count the set as successful as long as I maintain the minimum pace for the entire 15 minutes. I usually have no issue covering ground for the prescribed set, so this is the easiest option to go with. 

My understanding of C210K is that the goal of each workout is to jog the whole set and only walk during prescribed rests, so naturally, I want to go with option 2, but since I am building back my aerobic base I'm not sure which option is the most appropriate and best at producing long term gains.

I routinely take a treadmill class, and noticed I was plateuing with my top interval speed. One day my socks got wet so I ran without, and I noticed that my grip and balance on the treadmill improved significantly, which let me run faster than I had in the past year. A lot of A/B testing with different types of socks and shoes, and I believe that one of the limiters on my previous speeds was trying to balance/gain traction in my shoe due to the instability caused by my socks.

I also run in a pretty minimal/airy shoe (Nike Flyknit) that has no odor whatsoever after all my runs, and I'm a heavy sweater.

running,"*I have been running inconsistently for years but I have only started taking running seriously recently and learning new things each day, I wouldn’t call myself an expert, just someone with endurance and speed*

Hi, I have always been a short distance runner but it is until recently when I decided that I really want to run a marathon one day so I have increased my distance. I usually do 10kms weekly, do HIIT treadmills and once a month I aim to run a distance that is more than half a marathon long. *more running is bound to take place as time passes by*

Now when I was a short distance runner, I used to always run with a water bottle until my cousin told me “it is weird to run with water” and I guess that kind of stuck with me. Because of that I can now run up to 22kms without a single drop of water inside of me and I have never thought I needed any energy boosters/supplements etc. 

One of my friends heard about this and warned me about the dangers of doing this (telling me how I am losing so much water and nutrients esp in my long distance runs that I really need the water/supplements etc) but I guess when I am used to running with nothing on my hands but my phone for years, it is v weird to start carrying a water bottle again (does not help that mine is twice the size of my hand) 

I guess my question is how much water does one need for half a marathon &amp; a marathon (so I can buy the appropriate water bottle size) and what energy booster, food, supplements should I be taking during my 20kms+ runs? Is it also necessary to carry water or supplements during my 10kms runs as I usually complete them under an hour and I don’t think it is necessary (but I could be wrong, always up to be corrected!)

Hi… I was wondering if someone can guide me through next step.

I started running around two years ago.
I tried the C25K program but I didn’t finish it as I couldn’t not keep doing the running sections. They were tiring.

I found that I can’t run for long distances otherwise I will start going out of breath and eventually stop the session.

I also found that I was getting tired mentally, my brain was like: “stop man… you’ve been running for long now, your muscles must be achy”. 

What I did was I started jogging for longer periods and I found success.

I did two 10k races within two years.

First one finished it at 01:05:45
With the buzz and race atmosphere I found myself running, not jogging. But at 6km I was exhausted, I walked it a bit, ran, walking… then finishing the race.

The second race’s time was disappointing as I thought I will finish it in a shorter time, it was 01:07:33. 

Although in this one I never stopped or walked. It was all jogging but exhaustion hit me at 8km.

Now I am not sure how to improve.  

I aim to run the 10k next year and finish in less than an hour, or at least score better timing than the current one.

running,"Hi r/running,

I hope you don't mind but I first wanted to thank you : yesterday, I accomplished my first back-to-back run since... a long time ago : 14,7 km (9,1m) on a hillish path at 30°C (86°F) this monday, after a 10,4km (6,5m) run on sunday.

Now, I totally realize that these runs are like a warm-up for 85% of this sub but as a 34-years-old guy who used to suffer a lot from the knees and the back, I'm really happy. I spent this past year strengthening my legs and my back (I still can do better ofc), changing the way I run (I used to run on my heels) with better shoes, listening to my body and improving from a difficult 25 min run to now a pretty comfortable 1:30 one. And it's in big part because of the intel I've gained reading you, so thank you a lot.

Now, I know that I want more (half, marathon or even trail) but that I still have a looong way to go and need to remember that my body is not ready for the whole thing : this morning, I wanted to try a third run in a row but my legs are still a bit sore, the heat is higher, I think it'd be stupid. So, probably a bit of cycling.

But I'd like some advices about how you fight your impatience and what's the best way for you to accumulate kilometers with consistency without hurting you.

running,"Hello everybody, just want to share my realization I had today after my long run.


I used to struggle with my pace all the time, getting winded and tired really early in my runs. To get straight to the advice: run in the places you can't see yourself.


I mainly ran in the streets, where there are shop windows, mirrors and I could always check out my reflection in those. Let's face it: you look really cool when you run fast. So I used to try to always look cool and pick up my pace whenever I saw my reflection. 


This is purely mental. Now I run along the river shore and in the nearby park, and I find it MUCH easier to maintain my pace and worry less about looking cool. 

My second bonus advice: incorporate run/walk splits, especially on long runs. Today I ran 15K, 4 min run 1 minute walk time, I honestly am not really tired. Those walking minutes really help my recovery during splits and also the workouts.


Hope I helped someone with this post! Any type of advice/answer is appreciated!",my weird advice for people who struggle with pacing themselves.

### Training
My training was pretty hectic before the race, there was alot of mistakes and holes in my training.
On some days i would only go for a run about 5-7 miles but on most days i would only manage 1-3 miles at an unsteady and unmanaged pace which would eventually prove to be one of my biggest flaws.

### Pre-race
I ate pho the day before the race and did a light run on the hotel treadmill, i felt a little tight but it wasn’t anything that would severely hinder my run

### Race
Day of the race everything felt really good going 5km in so much so that i went out wayyyy too fast, this is where my race fell apart as i slowed down dramatically in the upcoming hills. My pace was heavily impacted and i was feeling horrible. Closing mile i had put whatever i had left all on the line to barely go under the 40 minute mark.

### Post-race
There was alot that I learned in this 10k and i am very grateful that it taught me a lesson. A big lesson i learned was that i needed to apply more milage to my training in order to maintain the pace that i wanted to keep. Another big lesson was the issue with the hills, when i would go on runs I would only train on flat surfaces with little to no elevation change which was made apparent by my splits as my run reached the 4-5 mile marker.
Lately I’ve done my best to fix these issues. A big takeaway from this race was that I was impressed with what i could do and the feeling that i could really improve if i applied what i learned on my run into my training.

Ironically Garmin’s Zone 3 IS where I should be in zone 2. Now that I’ve thought about it, it was strange that on paper I should be able to easily run 8:40mi pace for 25 min tempo run as my program asked but the fatigue came very quickly in my quads and especially my calves ruining it.

I have done a handful of HMs in the past and one full, but my mileage isn't that high right now. I am not slow, but not fast.

I also do shotokan classes twice a week. They're not super hardcore, but obviously involve a lot of lunging, kicking, holding stances, etc.

Not sure if it's a ligament or my adductors or hip flexors, but that area always feels beat up and it seems like i am getting less flexible rather than more over time.

After the accident, I continued to ride horses and I felt like the core and hip mobility/strength I gained from riding really helped me run and not be in pain from the accident. 

I haven’t rode in about two years now, and have clearly lost a lot of that strength. I started running a few months ago and did too much too quick and got really bad shin splints. I healed up and have begun again taking it slow but I noticed my knees kill me as well as the front/side of my hips after an easy 20 min run.

I'm not sure which type of shoe I should pursue since about half of the time I walk on concrete and half of the other time I walk on terrain (in the same trip).

I (30m) am dealing currently with my 1st major injury - a bone fracture.
I was in the middle of my training season, refining my times for some 5 and 10k later down the summer and I got completely stopped by what seems to be a bone fissure on my right foot. Long story short, I went for an early jog yesterday morning, wanted to cross the street, checked the road for cars and while checking and running in the same time I landed from the sidewalk on the road right on my ankle. Needless to say the pain was instant, I felt the infamous pop and I knew it's not a good sign. Luckily I manage to limp home.
From today my foot is in a cast, I have to use crutches and pray that everything goes back to normal asap. What's worse is that I can't stop blaming myself for not paying attention to the road ahead of me and slowing down before attempting to cross the street... I feel that it was really avoidable and that makes me feel so bad now... I guess it's as they say it that, we live and learn from mistakes.

Focus has been on achieving ideal weight. Am 10 kgs over weight compared to ideal weight that should be. Doctor too has mentioned reduce weight as it seems to be of all issues identified.

Hence, I started focussing on my health from Jan'22 and I do :

1). Mix of walk/run for 5-6 kms daily - 1 km Run then rest walk, aim to cover more distance in running   

by 2022 end. Today, it takes 45 mins to cover the distance.

2). Gym - Focus on strength more and then obviously for weight loss. 

3). I am following healthy diet now, earlier I used to survive on everything that isn't healthy/late meals

The issue is that every-time I start to run it hurts. I can touch my arch and heel after running/walking and it hurts. The outer foot pain only hurts when I have sneakers on and walk or run. I do use wide hoka bondis, and wide ASICS.

So, now I’m just wondering, how do I fix this? I have a shiatsu foot massager but is there anything else I can do?",Outer foot pain

I started training about 3 weeks ago and the race was this weekend. 27:44 was my official time and I might actually really like running now? My legs felt great, but I think what held me back (cause me to have to slow down/walk a couple minutes) was my breathing. I just finally got out of breath.

running,"Over the past few months I've been noticing a dramatic increase in leg soreness from running and I can't quite figure out why. I ran a 5k in early June (PR of 21 flat) about 6 weeks after running a half and I feel like the soreness started somewhere in between those two races, but I hadn't increased mileage (\~25-30mpw spread over 4-5 runs consistently for the last 6 months) and even reduced intensity after the half. About a month ago I decided to eliminate speed work entirely (was doing 1 relatively short session per week before that) but that didn't seem to help at all. I've now been running all of my runs at a fairly easy pace (9:30 min/mile) but still - so sore! This level of soreness is not like anything I've ever experienced but it is distinctly a feeling of soreness and not any type of sharp pain and is concentrated in my quads (including inner and outer thighs). For context, I don't stretch much and also don't do any strength training at the moment. I know I should incorporate both, but any other recovery tips to reduce soreness?

running,"Why does my heart rate go past 200 bpm so quickly into my run? I can reach 200 bmp in a quarter of a mile at an 11 minute mile pace. Im in my early 20s with a healthy BMI, did gymnastics growing up so I’ve always had some muscle on me. Always struggled with endurance. I used to run a mile everyday but my heart rate always went above 200 bpm. The highest I’ve seen it was on the elliptical when it reached 220. I know the number is accurate because I’ve used several machines and the values have matched with my heart rate monitor. 

I mentioned this to my primary care doc and he said he isn’t concerned because I’m young and healthy. He said that’s everyone’s heart rates vary and I’m probably on the higher end of the spectrum. He did mention that I have an arrhythmia which was confirmed on EKG but again he said it’s common in young people.

running,"          Hi, I was hoping that somebody here would be able to help me choose what running shoes to buy. I run cross country in high school and for the last 3 years I've been wearing New Balance 635v2 (they aren't made anymore). Those shoes are pretty lightweight and don't have much cushioning, but I wore them for all of my runs, including races.

       This track season I got spikes for the first time so I figured I would get some heavier, more cushioned shoes for training runs. I ended but getting NB 860v11, which felt nice in the store and when I first started running in them. However, after a few weeks my big toe joints (like the part on the inside of the foot that sticks out a little bit) started hurting when I ran and sometimes was sore even when I wasn't running. It felt like my toe wasn't used to the front part being so thick or something? I kept running in them for like a month and a half or so because I thought I just had to break them in or whatever but one time I literally stopped because it hurt so bad so I switched back to my old shoes. My toes don't hurt at least.

          I really need new shoes though because my old ones have over 800 miles on them and have no cushioning left. Does anyone have any shoe recommendations or any thoughts to why my new shoes make my toes hurt? Any help is appreciated! Thanks!",What shoes should I get?

running,"I’m not terribly upset about my pace, but recently I’ve been trying more interval type runs and sprinkling in some time trials, and it’s been bothering me how my “best” doesn’t feel too far off from the pace I managed to run 10 miles at the other day. 

I guess in general I have this trend of running shorter distances at a slower pace than should be expected given my longer runs. For example, I can’t run a 5k in under 25 minutes, but I can run a 10k in under 50 minutes and a half marathon in 105 minutes (which is basically a 25 minute 5k pace). On a track, 400m takes me 1:50, 800m takes 3:40, and 1600m takes me 6:57.

I am heavy, currently weighing in at about 238lbs but am 28 pounds down from when I started eating better and swimming in January. 

Never thought I would ever even _dream_ of going for a run, but the weight is now not coming off as quickly so I wanted to incorporate something else into my exercise.

I am the kind of person who, if I said to my friends I was going for a run, nobody would believe me. _I_ wouldn’t believe me. I had always joked about these people being lunatics; why would anyone willingly put themselves through that? 

But then, for some unknown reason, I downloaded the C25K app one evening and was amazed at myself when I actually headed out the door for my first run. 90 sec walks and 60 sec runs was killing me, but I did it. 

I’ve just finished my third run, still doing 90 sec walks and 60 sec runs but about halfway through something I never thought possible happened. 

I felt _great_. 

Like, beaming as I ran. It’s 9am on a Sunday, I’m in an empty park, the sky is blue, sun is shining, I’m listening to I Love LA by Randy Newman and I’m just grinning as I run.

For this reason, a lot of us decide to run in places where the amount of stoplights you have to go through are minimal.

Now, maybe I'm preaching to the choir here but pedestrians have the right of way most of the time (for example, on a green light where the pedestrian is crossing). What this means is that drivers need to take extra caution when driving around runners and walkers. Today I had someone turn right in front of me when I had the right of way to cross. If I hadn't stopped I would have been hit and injured.

running,"Hi all, 

I got a pair of Hoka Arahi 6, wide fit shoes last week. I went to a specialty shop where they did gait analysis and measured my feet. Then they recommended some different pairs of shoes for me. In the store, all felt comfortable so I chose the Hokas as I heard some good things and I always wanted to try them. The thing is, the next day I went for an 8 mi run in them. Around halfway I got huge blisters along my inner heels, which was really painful. I thought maybe I shouldn't have done such a long run the first time. 

Next time, after the blisters healed I did my weekday 3 milers, but I could still feel that this spot was not very comfortable, but at least the blisters didn't come back. 

Then yesterday I did 13 miles in them for my long run, and the huge blisters returned halfway again. So much pain! :(

I did heel lock which helps a little bit, but I didn't try different socks yet. The shoes feel like my running size, perhaps slightly bigger (1 size up instead of half, but they feel ""snug"" like they should) but I thought that will be handy in this really hot weather where my feet swell a lot. I think the issue may be that around the heel area, there is this harder material, it's not really forming to my feet and now I can feel this little hard bit on the sides on the inner heels. Also, when I'm walking, I can feel my heel sinking into the cushion, but the actual sides of the shoe stay in place, so my heels sink down slightly rubbing the side. I think that hard bit is putting pressure on that spot at each step as well.  

Has anyone experienced this before? Do you think the shoes may form to my feet or should I just try to return them?

I asked if they had low drop, and the kid said yes they did. I couldn’t really tell by looking at them, but it turns out they have a 10 mm drop which is not low drop. They felt fine walking around the store.

running,"Hi everyone,  
I am aspiring to join the military after graduating from university. I have generally led a pretty active lifestyle but I want to start getting a bit more serious into my training preparation in the running aspect.

The physical assessment in my country (Korea) deems you an ‘A grade’ runner if you can clock 1.5km within 5 minutes. Right now I can finish 1.5 in about 6 minutes and 30 seconds. I have about 6 months left to train before I graduate. I am slightly worried or maybe even pessimistic if I can achieve this time in such a short time :(. However I am willing to work very hard to achieve this A grade even if I don’t require it to pass the assessment.  
Any tips on a training plan would be greatly appreciated! I’m a complete beginner in this field and would be very happy to take in any advice and criticisms.  
Thank you :)",Training plan advice
running,"15 days ago I sprained my MCL, about that I am certain. However the degree to which I injured the ligament is unclear, and whether there are injuries to other structures, such as the medial meniscus.  
Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4UktqZjev-c&amp;list=PLL6c3L5q9c0iAbCTvFazHXA4QKmseCfTo&amp;index=8&amp;t=3s) showing a nearly identical fall made by Steph Curry resulting in a grade 2 MCL sprain.

I'll ask the question here so you don't have to read if you don't want, but I've provided more details about the injury below if needed.  


**Is it normal to lose range of motion after an isolated MCL injury? I still cant extend my knee to 0\* or flex the knee &gt;90\* after 15 days. When I try to extend my knee to 0 degrees there is no pain but it just feels like I can't do it. Almost like I forgot how, or as if there's something physically preventing blocking me from doing it. And when I try to flex my knee further than 90 degrees I feel intense pain at the attachment point of the MCL. I cant tell if it's just because the MCL is tightened up or I also sustained an injury to another structure that's causing the loss of range of motion. For those who have experienced MCL injuries, were you also unable to fully extend and flex your knee? If so, how long did that last? What did you do to correct it?**

When the injury occurred I don't remember hearing a pop, but I vaguely remember there being a mild tearing sensation and then immediate sharp pain on the medial aspect of my knee near the femoral epicondyle. There was very minimal swelling on the medial side of my knee, and I could not detect any interarticular swelling within the knee joint itself. The pain was throbbing and intense, and seemed to be present whether I applied weight to the leg or not, but increased if I put weight on it. The injury occurred in the evening, that night I researched the structures of the knee and common injuries and concluded that, at the very least, I had injured my MCL.  I woke up the following morning in even more pain, and decided went to see a doctor at urgent care.  


After taking history of the injury the doctor performed a valgus stress test, which produced pain at the medial femoral epicondyle and a small degree of laxity at the joint. He concluded that I had sustained an injury to my MCL and diagnosed me with an MCL sprain. However, he did not specify what grade the sprain was. He also palpated the medial aspect of my Tibial-femoral joint, which produced some pain, and said I may have also damaged my medial meniscus, but he was entirely certain because that could just be radiated pain from the MCL.  


For the first 5 days post injury I RICEd and took 500mg naproxen to reduce inflammation. I used crutches for the first 2 days, and have been wearing a knee brace since day 1 until now. On about the 3rd day I was able to start bearing weight on the leg with out much pain as long as the weight was applied straight down. The leg feels fairly stable, but I still feel intense pain on the medial side of my knee if I accidently bump my knee laterally (valgus stress). I started on a regiment of light extension and flexion stretches in attempt to regain RoM yesterday, this morning I woke up and my knee was in even more pain than usual.

Long time lurker here. Bit of a boring admin question I’m afraid.

I started a garmin couch to 5k program and in the 4th week had a stress reaction/hairline fracture in my right tibia. My orthopedic surgeon was dumbfounded how I ended up with it when I was only running 1-2 miles a few times a week so he told me to just take a month off. After a month off I went back to running and by my 3rd short jog had started feeling the pain again. I repeated this same process for 1.2 years taking 2 weeks to 2 months off each time returning to injury instantly. Finally I fully took 3 months off from running and came back and started being able to run 2 miles 3-4 times per week for a month without injury.

running,"Came across this video on youtube about running drills and form https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR2MyqYs1pA

I've never done any track or cross country and I was wondering, have any of you ever done stuff like this? Would the stuff shown there be done during practice? How would you program those drills into your training cycle/week/day? 

Although I can see how the skills involved in those drills do bear some semblance to running, I'm skeptical as to how much of it would transfer into running better. I've done combat sports where focused drills as opposed to relatively free/live sparring are very essential to your development, in some disciplines more than others (more in grappling than in striking) and although I've never really competed in Powerlifting (as in done any meets), I've benched, squatted and deadlifted, and really specific technique work usually isn't really done at all unless you've got some glaring form issues which can be addressed by form cues but not so much specific drills. Which is quite different from Weightlifting (the Olympic sport), despite the latter comprising of only 2 lifts, you are required to dedicate quite a bit of your time on doing technique, usually with a lot more training frequency than Powerlifting. The way I see it, the more technical your sport is, the more you'd have to spend on time drilling/variety of drills. I'm not sure if it's actually the case but straight up running to me seems like it would be even less technical than powerlifting. There's only really one discipline and there's not really any compounding of really differing skills. Like with a clean and jerk or pole vaulting or any kind of jump events, where there's very distinct components in your discipline. Obviously, I'd believe that the majority of your running training should consist of actual running, but should there be any place at all for those drills shown in the video? Should it be relegated to a quick warmup or would it be advantageous to dedicate more time for them? Have any of you ever done those and how do you feel it has helped you with your running?","Kenya Form Running, drills vs doing your sport."

I’ve been training consistently for my first marathon in November (yes, the NYC). I’ve never been into racing until this year. I’ve competed in some 1/2s, and 5Ks. I told myself I’d never do a full marathon but here I am. And I’ve been enjoying it until recently. 

I started consistently running/training for this marathon in April (I had a surgery in March). In April I ran 98 miles, May I ran 116 and June I ran 153. Average pace is around 9’50. My heart rate remains around 150 bpm. I ran a 5k for fun a few weeks ago and managed to keep a 7’30 pace, so the speed is there. 

After the surgery I began running 20 miles a week and added two miles each week. Im up to 35 miles per week and my long run is 11 miles. 

This week was rough. I feel mentally burned out and I have some outside stressors as well. And todays run was terrible. In fact, I think I pulled something on my right hip. Mile 5 I quit and was limping back to the car. Needless to say, I’m burned out mentally and physically. 

Next week I’m on vacation and thought about either not running or only running 15-20 miles depending on my mood and physical condition.

So in order to still keep in shape and improve my cardio I decided that I would go for runs while my elbow recovers.

I downloaded a running app that tracks your distance and your pace and on my first ever run, I ended up running just over 10km with an average pace of 5:30 per km. 

It wasnt until I got home from my run and checked the app that I had actually realized just how much I ran but I wasnt sure if my pace was considered good or not. So I did some googling and it turns out, that's extremely good for somebody who has never ran in their life which has inspired me to take up running more often.

So the next day, I tried to go for a run but I could barely even make it 2km because of how tight all of my muscles were. I stretch for about 30 mins daily and previous to my injury I was constantly at the gym lifting weights for strength. And I eat incredibly healthy and drink roughly 4 litres of water a day so I dont think it has to do with poor lifestyle or dehydration or anything like that. I think it really just has to do with being a beginner.

So I guess my question is, how often do runners actually run and what distance? Are people actually out there running long distance every single day?

### Training
At the end of 2020 I set myself the goal of completing a marathon in 2022. To build up to the distance, I would first complete a 10km and then attempt a half-marathon. For these events I used the Run Less Run Faster training plans which suited my busy professional and family life. I also enjoy mixing in the cross training. 

### Pre-race
I travelled with my family to the Gold Coast. We arrived a couple of days in advance so I'd get at least full good night's sleep before the race. 

The Gold Coast had a really good vibe throughout the weekend. I picked up my race bib and a couple of other items at The ASICS Sport and Leisure Expo the day before. The half-marathon was held the day before the full. It was raining so decided to watch the live stream of the event rather than head out in the weather. 

I set out my kit the night before which included:
ASICS Actibreeze Ventilate Singlet
Rabbit Speedster half tights
ASICS Metaspeed Sky
Fractel cap

I also had a stack of Maurtens which I planned to take every 30 mins and a hand-held flask with 500ml of Gatorade.

I woke at 3:55am, had breakfast, got ready and caught the tram from our hotel in Surfers to Broadwater Parklands for the 6am start.

### Race
My goal was a sub-3:40 so I made sure I lined up in the vicinity of the pacers for this time. They had big white balloons tied to their kit which made it easy to spot them. For the first 25-28km I felt comfortable holding the 5:07/km pace and the Ks seemed to click by. It felt easier being part of the pace group. It was reassuring knowing I could sit in the group and not worry too much about whether I was hitting my splits. I think it saved a lot of mental energy (which I would need later in the race). 

I kept up my gel consumption every 30-35mins including a caffiene gel around half-way. I also tried to grab water at the refreshment stations every 5km after my hand-held depleted. I knew the last 10km would be the real test though and it was. That last 45mins or so had to be the longest hour of my life. My legs had little left in them and at that point I was running mostly on pure will. But I knew I had to keep up the pace to get under 3:40. I could hear the second pacer gradually catching up with me, encouraging those around him, which suggested it was going to be close. The crowd was awesome and definitely helped in the last few KMs. I crossed the line in 3 hours 38 minutes - pretty much right on my goal race time. My legs were trashed by the end so picking up my medal and finishers pack was almost as grueling as the race itself!

### Post-race
I had some pretty serious DOMS for a few days. My knees and ankles were also sore the first day or so. Unusually, my thighs was where the DOMS hung around for longest. (I had never felt thigh/quad soreness in training.) I have stuck to walking and a light jog yesterday to keep the wheels moving since the race. Already looking forward to setting the next running goals!

running,"Hello everybody!

I have searched about calf cramping and tightness on my particular case in this sub to no avail. Also I am not looking for medical advise.

A few nights ago I had severe cramping on my right calf that woke me up at 2am almost screaming. Afterwards, I still get either cramps at night, or the 'aura' of cramping, in which case I try to stretch in bed until it passes - but my calves remain sore and tight the entire day. It never cramped during a run, but since I am on a treadmill it scares me it will happen and I would go off flying backwards.

As for my routine  I've switched to treadmill running for the winter. I don't do much: one 8/9km threshold on sundays, easy 8k mondays, 8k with hills tuesdays, 8k with speed interval on tuesdays and a 15/16k easy on fridays. I also do leg/core work on sundays and tuesdays and upperbody/core work on tuesdays, and practice yoga monday, wednesday and saturday, the latter two I consider my 'rest days'.

I admit I am not very dilligent with stretching. Besides the tightness, I have experienced pain/weakness/instability feeling on my right knee, which suggests bad form. 

As for my diet, I eat a LOT of low sodium/hight potassium salt, and eat salty foods like soy sauce, gerkings, mustard and so on. I also drink 2l of water, and tea or coffee on top of that. If I did a long/hard run I may drink pedialyte or gatoradd after my run, but if not, I just do water.


I sleep poorly -5 hours tops, since I want to get my run before work, and go to bed around 12am. Naps are also not a possibility.

So onto my question: Should I dial back? I thought yaking 2 rest days a week was a lot - but maybe I should dial it back or take a few days off to focus on yoga/strenght/stretching, then come back to it refreshed? I do feel kind of burnt out.

Are there any way to prevent calves cramps, sore/tired legs, etc? I admit I should stretch more, but most tightness I feel in bed, not on my runs.

Thanks in advance!",Cramping calves in bed - time for a break?

For those not aware summer in Japan is HELL, and today was a particular hot and humid day (98%), so the run was harder than usual, at the end I was done for and thoughts of ""stop"" began racing my mind. I don't know why but i began imagining all my friends, loved ones around me and cheering me up, like i was about to cross a finish line, but it was still hard, and then the image of a very special person appeared just in front of me and i could see her screaming and cheering and pushing me on, all of sudden I felt an absolute intense heat all over my body, i never felt anything like it before, my mind went blank and i just powered through the final part of my run like it was nothing. at the end my HR was 192 (it usually hovers around 170-180).

I'm fairly new in the running world and have been enjoying myself!!

I've been reading lots of advice on this subreddit and have learned a ton. 

Currently I've been averaging 2-3 runs a week at about 5k. I've read to run slow at first. Real slow. My best 5k time is about 37 minutes. This is through slow jogging and walking when my HR goes above 170. My average heart rate during runs is about 154.

Been a runner for majority of my life, typically never running for more than 5 miles a day except for the long run days. I currently compete in local 5ks and run around 17:58s. 

Growing up my father always took me on runs and he ran the LA marathon back in the 90s and ran 3:26 @ 25 yr. My goal ever since being a kid was to beat his time. I’m 21 now and have taken running more serious. Completing it younger than him will give me more style points and bragging rights :) 

The 2023 LA marathon is March 19th which is a many months ahead so I got time but with all the time I have I absolutely want to obliterate his finishing time, maybe run 3:15s ( I don’t know how feasible that is). I’m assuming most marathon prep plans are 16 weeks long giving me time until Nov 27th before the 16 week plan begins. 

So from now until Nov 27th I was thinking of maybe following multiple 10k and half marathon plan and running those races then leverage that up into a high tempo 16 week Marathon plan.

running,"Backpacking on the post the other day of heat and summer time. I had a run today outside my normal climate and it had me thinking… 

We all know how the heat effects us but I’ve never thought about using it to my advantage or if I could… I’ve heard (have not confirmed) how runners would run in high altitudes for better endurance at lower alt races, as the less oxygen at high would enable them to run better/ push themselves harder with the surplus of O2 for a race. Is that true and if so would be possible/ does anyone have experience in hot/cold training? 

A little background - I hope this is allowed. I’m not trying to self promote, instead trying to explain for context: I live in a VERY hot and humid area, year round but especially during summer. My most normal run is 5.5 miles (short is 4, long is 7.5), I run those outside in that climate. When at work (different areas around the US) it’s always the gym. I’ve started to venture outside. Recently, one was 101deg and DRY (4 miles) definitely hard/ very different, this one today was beautiful 74 no humidity, light sun (6.7miles).

This run today, the 74 deg, my pace was amazing (a lot faster), it felt wonderful, and I didn’t want to stop running. I went through one water bottle (INSANE FOR ME). I had to call it to be back by a certain time but I could have kept going and definitely could have pushed for a faster pace. It felt so good and nothing like my runs back home. The run was easy at the faster pace and after I felt like so good and wasn’t exhausted. 

My back home runs same distance are obviously slower, harder, im dripping wet of the sweat beading off, three water bottles, etc. I feel so drained. 

So we know the heat effects us but this was my first “WOW.” I didn’t realize how much because I’ve always ran in heat, I just thought I was slow, lol. 

So has anyone trained like this - where is the better area to push to make the other run easier? Does anyone have experiences with contrasting climate endurance training and experienced something so drastic and how have you used it to your advantage? As well as altitudes, what are some experience with running at different altitudes with personal performance getting better or worse?

running,"I run XC, and due to a lot of different factors I don’t have time to explain, I have the hottest fire burning in my belly and such a strong obsession with wanting to improve every run. I realize I have developed a ‘Train Everyday, No Matter What’ mindset during the last handful of months leading up to the start of the season.

running,"I am a very amateur hobby runner and I'm currently working on increasing cadence as per my physiotherapist's request (in the process of working on reversing a mild posterior tibial tendon injury and preventing it in the future). I've gone on about 5 runs since she asked this, shortening my stride and running to 180 bpm music as I tend to fall into the rhythm of what I'm running to. It's definitely helping decrease the load on my tendons, but I am... not totally enjoying it hahahaha

I think maybe I just had a crappy run this morning, it's hot and I'm a bit tired, but I am feeling a little discouraged. I'm having to maintain a high level of focus, not able to zone out to music I like, and am still getting more tired from the faster turnover.

The questions:
- what HR should I be hitting in the hard intervals? My experience - I gradually hit ~180 bpm in the last 1-3 intervals which is almost exactly the zone 4-5 threshold
- what is good 1min HR recovery between intervals? Mine is 20-25 bpm which seems quite bad to me?

running,"Hey all! Seeking some advice on technique. I ran cross country for more than seven years, but I never was taught form. I ended up injuring my knee quite a bit. So, I’m trying to learn the proper technique now. A few times this year I reached a flow state where I felt springy, and I could just float past the ground. It was intoxicating, so I really want to get the form right now!

As I build proper form, I find that when I run I focus on a specific technique element in my head. I also notice that if I start a run with good technique, I maintain it. So, I’ve written a preflight checklist and write up of sorts for myself and would like to share in case it helps anyone and for feedback. It seems like there’s a lot of conflicting info online (some bro science too), but this is what I gathered.

This is what happens when you run with good form:

&gt;	The foot lands under the center of mass, with the body having a slight tilt forwards.
The foot lands midsole or forefoot.
As the foot pushes back and then peels off the ground, it lifts itself higher than the knee. The knee folds into a tighter shape to facilitate the foot’s movement forwards (tighter lever).

Checklist:

1.	Run tall.
2.	Consciously focus on slightly leaning forward with whole body and landing foot on midsole under the body (closer to center of mass). Great runners seem to have a very defined pawback
3.	Speed up cadence a bit
4.	Consciously focus on lifting and folding the knee after the push so swinging leg forward is easier
5.	Focus on minimizing vertical oscillation. Don’t push up!
6.	Maintain cadence and crispy movement.

A reflection on why my knee keeps getting injured: perhaps vertical oscillation. I bounce a lot. It’s likely that my lack of hip flexibility means that my legs have a narrower possible angle of running than they should. This means that in order to go forward, I need to put in extra energy through my ankles which makes me spring upwards. This also explains why I occasionally reach running nirvana amidst adrenaline after 3 miles — my hip is limber and flexible, so I’m powering with my glutes and hip rather than my ankle and calves. 

The solution, beyond increasing cadence, is to bring the foot up after ground contact in such a way that leg angle is wider. That begs the question — how long should ground contact be? Should my foot stay on the ground as long as it can behind me, or should I consciously lift it and bend the knee? And before striking the ground, how far forward can the foot be to assist in the power of the pawback (or should it be in front of the body)?

Thank you, hope this can help some people (especially if you’re in the same boat)",How to float over the ground?

I recently started to run, trying to make it a habit. I live in a small town with great paths so running there is a bliss with varying elevation and surfaces.

I feel comfortable on my pace and endurance, and felt at ease in some regard to obtaining these as I've been a cardio guy in the past.

So at-home workouts seem to be my answer. I own a pull-up bar, a yoga mat, and I'm happy to buy a kettlebell given its diversity.

So where should the focus be? What should the workout contain? Strength training is such a vague term. Am I working core? My back, chest, forearms, biceps..or is it a general upper body routine that doesn't focus or push any one section too hard?

running,"Have finally committed to a half marathon, in November! 

I’ve decided to pursue the Coach Galloway plan in Garmin Watch, which includes the run walk run method. Although I’m not sure how I feel about this yet… 

I entered into the plan my current running and pace, which is around 25km a week, running 6 min Ks. I don’t really do much speed work and feel very “steady” and consistent (which is why I’m not improving). I typically do 5 runs a week, so 5ks (3 miles) at a time. I mostly run to listen to music or a podcast, so don’t necessarily consider it “training”. 

So I did the first workout today, a benchmark run, all good.

Then the Garmin coach revealed my first “slow long run” to do this weekend and it wants me to do 11.2km?? This seems a massive leap for someone who rarely runs more than 6km? 

So I want to keep with the plan, but worried about injury. Is this safe? I would do it super slow, but my usual pace already feels super slow… The plan also is not telling me to “walk” any of this.",My first “long run” of 1/2 marathon plan is 11km. Seems a lot?

So I have somewhat of a desire to run a marathon but pretty much no desire to train for a marathon. I run about 25-30 miles a week, 5-6 days a week. Most my runs are 3-5 miles. If I do a “long” run it might be 7-9 miles. I’ve run one half marathon race and time was just under 1:35. Longest duration I’ve ever run is 2 hrs. I also do a fair amount of weight training. Part of what I enjoy about running is just going out and doing whatever I feel like that day, and following a specific training plan I think would suck a lot of the joy out of it.

running,"Hi there, new to running. Used to do it for fun like 2 decades ago in high school but now I need to lose weight due to health concerns. I understand I could use an elliptical but I really like the outside fresh air and running around my local lake. I just started taking this up seriously 2 weeks or so ago, and about 5 days of the week I am running at night for 2 miles straight. I didn’t have proper footwear until yesterday, now I have a really nice pair of Brooks Glycerin 20 GTS’s. Anyhow, every time I get back from running I have a shooting/throbbing pain in my right leg on the outside of my knee that radiates down the outside of my calf muscle. A little pain also in the inner part of that knee as well, but not nearly as much. This usually persists for about 30-40 minutes, maybe a 5/10 pain but it’s quite jarring and I have to immediately get in a cold bath to relieve it. What is this? Shin splints? Some kind of ligament strain or tear? I don’t want to give up running outside because I really enjoy it and I NEED to lose weight. I will say like 17 years ago in high school I broke my OTHER leg’s femur in half and got a metal rod and screws in there, so that leg didn’t quite grow as long as the one that’s hurting (right leg).

running,"So about four hours ago I got back from a run which was a little tougher than average, but not massively so. Specifically, it was a half marathon on hilly trails near me (500m elevation gain), with a time of almost dead on 2 hours. This isn't out of the ordinary for me (e.g., a couple of weeks ago I did three similar half marathons in four days), and although it was quite a hot evening I didn't feel particularly bad when I got in. However, after about an hour of feeling ok, I got some pretty intense nausea and couldn't even sit up straight anymore. I pretty much just collapsed on the floor and felt so bad I could barely move (a little worrying, because I live alone) or even open my eyes. I got the shivers and the cold sweats like I was in fever, and felt like I was going to throw up (but didn't because my stomach was empty). I tried eating to get a bit of strength in, but could barely muster the energy or appetite for a single chocolate biscuit across two hours. The nausea only just passed about half an hour ago, and I'm now feeling very weak and achey but otherwise fine.

Now I'm familiar with ""runner's stomach"" and that the motion can cause nausea, but what I don't understand is what I did so wrong to cause this pretty intense reaction after a fairly standard run? I ate a good lunch about 2-3 hours before running, so wasn't under-nourished. I had a couple of glasses of water before I went out, and a few more when I got back too, so I don't think I was hydrated. I have on a couple of times in the past experienced exhaustion after failing to eat/drink properly before longer runs or bike rides, but when I got back this time I didn't feel anywhere near as bad as I did on those occasions.

Also, it seems like some gear just doesn't come in my size - there was a belt I really wanted that only goes up to a M/L. I also know that clothing/wearables don't always fit me the way they fit thinner people. (This is also a bit of a mini vent about feeling excluded from my hobby/preferred exercise method due to size). 

I've been wearing my (tbh ugly but did the job) shorts for years and they've held up really well, but the chub rub has finally won. I definitely have an issue with thigh gobbling but don't know if I just need to accept that. Also I've seen a lot of people suggesting wearing very short shorts, but I'm not sure if that works for people with thighs that touch. I'm envisioning harsh friction burn lol 

I remember seeing a sports bra on tiktok that people were raving about and that was adjustable, but I haven't been able to find it since and would love to know if it's actually as amazing as they said it was. 

Does anyone have any recommendations? I'd love to hear about what clothes/products you may have tried that fit well, did the job, didn't bounce/chafe/ride up/etc., and ideally also looks nice. I'd also love to hear if there's any other gear I haven't thought of that could be useful. 


Also, just adding this here in case any new chubbo/fat runners are reading this and uncertain or nervous about running - I've been moderately active for years but only got into running during the pandemic. At first I struggled to go for even a few minutes (I tried too hard and went too fast), but I've now completed both a 10k and a half marathon - running the entire way. I'm pretty slow but damn do I go. At first I had anxiety every time before I started running (a relic from gym class trauma) but now I don't even think about it.

running,"Hey everyone,

I am training for a physical fitness test where we have to run two miles and do a 300m sprint. For rhe past 8 or 9 weeks I've been doing LSS running (60-70% of my heart rate) for anywhere between 45-60 minutes. I'm able to do this with relative ease now, and I'm wondering what else I can do to lower my run times. Should I go for longer distances? Do sprints?

A friend has told me that he's training by trying to increase the amount of time he can hold a six minute pace. One day he'll hold it for a minute. In a few days he'll try to hold it for a minute and ten seconds, etc. Is that a good plan, and if so what is it called?

running,"Don McNelly was 48 when he ran his first ever marathon. He would later go on to run 744 throughout his lifetime (running 29 marathons at the age of 85).

He recently passed away at the age of 96, but even at 96 he remained as mentally sharp as he’d ever been!

One of the most overlooked aspects (unfortunately) of running is the benefits that it has on brain function and it’s capacity to improve connections between different regions of the brain as well as dramatically increase neurogenesis.

Neurogenesis is the process by which new brain cell are produced in the adult brain. 

Marathon runners tend to perform better on cognitive tests and have better brain function overall. This is further supported by a number of studies that show that endurance runners have significantly different architecture from other athletes.

So, what makes endurance/marathon running different and so “special?”

Well… one hypothesis is that it’s the result of moderate (yet sustained) production of lactate by muscles during a 3-4 hour run that you don’t typically get with other forms of more acute exercise.

The brain appears to respond really well to this “low-level continuous infusion” of lactate and responds by adjusting levels of various neurotransmitters as well as increasing BDNF production — which is involved in neurogenesis.

Overall, this helps to prevent brain ageing and keep you mentally sharp even when your 96 years old like Don McNelly (aka an absolute legend).

running,"Hi, guys. I have been running with no problems for one month, but during one of my runs last week, I landed on my left foot with my heel waaay high off the ground and immediately felt a weird pain. After the run, it lingered for about 10 minutes then disappeared. It never bothered me after that until two days later when I tried to run and had to stop immediately due to the weird pain returning. I say weird pain because it isn’t like horrible or anything. Just REALLY  uncomfortable. I took 3 days off with no physical activity and as I didn’t feel anything, I tried running again and immediately felt the weird pain on the inside of my ankle; right above that protruding bone thing. Since I couldn’t run, I did 30 minutes high incline on the treadmill with no problem whatsoever. 

It doesn’t hurt to walk or even heavy squat but this morning while walking down a flight of stairs, as my left foot hit the ground, it returned. I also never had any swelling. 

I am not sure if it is a sprain, strain or broken anything so I’m here to see if any of you guys may possibly have experienced something similar and what measures I can take.

Hi all. I (19M) have a goal to run the mile in under 4:40 before I go back to university, which is 13 weeks away. I am a very inconsistent runner tbh, up until 2 weeks ago I had just been running 10-15 mpw at a comfortable 8:00min pace. I basically don't have an aerobic base.

I have decided to take my training more seriously by introducing some interval training and upping my mileage.

running,"So I'm a bigger guy.  I stand today at 205, 5'11.  At one point, I was 286, and running saved my life.  My very first run was 0.6 miles in 14 minutes.  I kept going, and then in 2018, I ran my first 5k, 10k, half marathon, and full marathon all in the same year.   I've run at least one marathon each year until 2020 hit and virtual runs just didn't tickle my fancy.   

My first marathon was in a very hilly city (Morgantown, WV) with a time of 4:36.  My 2nd was in Pittsburgh and I crossed at 4:06.  I'm like...ok, my life goal is 4:00.  My next 4 marathons, I never came close due to weather, injury, or personal lack of discipline.  I set out to run Buffalo in 2020, differed it to 2021, then differed it to 2022.  I decided that my training in all my other marathons was inadequate as I just ran to my own beat, 3 days a week, and just thought if I ran 20 miles a few times, I could do 26.  These runs were injury prone, set me back, caused me to have knee surgery due to heavy man destroying his knees, and I just wasn't getting there.

In 2022, I decided Buffalo NY was going to be it.  My sub 4:00 goal.  NOTHING would stop me.  I train in Pittsburgh and I decide on this running plan I saw that had me running 6 days a week.  I did it - til I couldn't.  It was too cold - something hurt - whatever.  But some days, there were days I didn't want to run, but I pushed myself outside.  Those were the days that helped later on - until I had an achilles issue for the first time ever.  I did some speed workouts and went too hard to which my achilles thanked me by popping every step.  I googled it and saw that it was from not stretching or overworking.  Decided then to stop speed workouts and just keep pressing tempo workouts and get the miles in.  It worked.  

Day before the race, I went to lay out my outfit as I always do.  Realized - shit, I packed the wrong socks.  EVERYTHING IS RUINED!  Felt that way for 10 seconds until I realized - well, you're here, don't waste what you worked for.  

Carb loaded, fueled, and motivated, I went out that morning with a mindset of holding my early pace steady - just stay around 9:00 miles and the rest will fall into place.  My pacer was wildly inconsistent - so I left him after mile 3 and just ran with my music and trusted my process.  Maintained a pace that surprised me a bit...managed to get to mile 20 at 2:52 when my goal was 3:00.  Kept doing math in my head to see when I could work in a walking break, but my body kept going...mile 21, still good.  Mile 22?  Still good.  Wait, why am I not dying?  Well, mile 23, I walked for 45 seconds and then went right back to running.  My girlfriend texted me and I saw it on my watch ""Don't slow down now, you're almost there!""  Every instinct in me to tell her ""YOU TRY RUNNING 23 MILES AND NOT SLOWING DOWN!""  She had texted me four times before with encouragement, so I realized she was on my side and I'd let that slide.  

She had been so supportive of my running.  ""Today isn't a rest day, why are you not gearing up?""  ""I can't believe you're running in the snow - you're insane.""  ""I'm proud of you.""  Something just gets you going when you have a supportive person in your corner in the days you just don't want to lace up.  

Mile 24, 25, and 26 came and went - slower than before, but I had so much time - mile 26 came at 3:48 and I'm like...I can crab walk to the goal and break my goal.  I called her while running...""I'm going to do it.  I'm going to break 4:00, and I couldn't have done it without you.""  She's emotional on the other side.  ""I'll be waiting for you, just get your ass to me.""

I have retired from marathon training.  Shit sucks.  So many miles from February through May until the taper.  Consumed my life.  Wouldn't have traded it for the world.

Why'd I write this?  Well, I've had a few beers, reflected on it, and hoped that this might encourage someone to chase their goals.  My goal now is to lead a couch to 5k program in my neighborhood and to become a pacer for half-marathons.  To help others reach their goals.  I got mine - now running is for fun.  Sort of.  I didn't run a mile in June.  I hated the thought.  Starting on July 4th, I've run a 5k each day, and part of it makes me feel alive again.  

Also, as a bonus, I've included a spreadsheet of my training plan, finishing times, marked all the skipped runs, tracked weather, weight, and cadence, and hope to instill the thought that if you get hurt, skip a run, or can't find motivation that day, that race day success makes all the suffering worth it.  If you're in Pittsburgh and want to meet up for a run, I'm in!

This has always been a problem for me and I have no lasting effects for it. It’s only when I run that I feel this. Almost instantly after I’m done I have no pain.

running,"So around 2019 I was a: 17.54 5k 38 minish 10k (I genuinely forget now) 1.25 half marathon and 3.18 marathon. Solid times. Not going to win anything obviously. But I should have been proud of those times.

But here's the thing. I wasn't. I **needed** to get faster. Even though I was never going to make the Olympics or anything like that (male in his 30s) all I could think was ""I must get faster"".

I put myself under tremendous pressure before races. I'd apologise to my club if I hadn't run fast enough in the **fun** run league races even though I was our highest scorer (I ran 15  league races and scored maximum points in 14 of them, the one I didn't was because I'd had an ultra the week before). 

Then two things happened. One I met the woman who would become my fiancee. Two covid. I probably got covid before it was offically covid - I had a continuous cough in January 2020 time. Soon after that races got cancelled. Then when they started up injuries happened. I was slower. Now my most recent marathon is.3.56. My most recent 5k is 21.40.

Here's the thing. I'm enjoying it more now. Back in '19 enjoyment was a dirty word. Enjoyment meant taking it easy which meant being  slow. Being slow was unacceptable. Therefore enjoying it was unacceptable. Which quite frankly was psychotic. I mean my standard there's no need to think like that.

Having a break from racing and then struggling with injury gave me perspective. Meeting a wonderful woman gave me perspective.

I run to keep myself fit - physically and mentally. I'm happier now despite being slower. I want to be faster - I want to get back to 5k times starting with a 1 rather than a 2 for instance.

running,"  A month ago I saw a flyer for a 10k race held on the 4h of July. I've been interested in running a 5k though I never committed to actually doing it and in reality it was all talk. I thought to myself why not, I can run 10k. 
  It had been 16 years since running the 2 mile in track and 13 years since playing high school sports. The only running I've done since was through playing with my kids and coaching various sports. 
  This didn't stop me and I began running that next Monday, but after 2 weeks of running I had a setback with a back injury and couldn't run for 6 days. I felt discouraged and wasn't sure if I would get a chance to run the 10k. After 6 days of only walking and recovering I eased back into running.
   I felt like I was completely starting over from my very first run. I kept grinding and working myself back up to where I was before the injury. With 10 days before the race I wanted to challenge myself and ran a hard 5 miles at 47.56. I felt good, I felt confident. My goal was to run the 10k under an hour and really felt that I could do that. 
  3 days before race day I woke up at 6 feeling very unmotivated and didn't want to run. I started with a slow walk and debating if I even run at all. I told myself just a light and easy jog will be good enough, but something happened and I just took off. I ended up running a 5k in 26.18 and had my best training run. I was feeling great and knew I could get under an hour. 
  July 4th arrived. It was my 32nd birthday but I didn't care. I only had one thought on my mind. I am speed, I kept telling myself after previously watching cars with my 10 month old son. I'm not going to lie, I had pre race jitters, I haven't competed in anything serious in 13 years and I had done a lot of hyping myself up and talking about running under an hour, a mixture of confidence and cockiness, but that's how I've always been as a competitor, like my first ever 2 mile race in 8th grade when I told coach Ayers I was going to break the school record and I did exactly that. 
   My wife, 3 daughters and baby boy showed up to support me with homemade signs saying, you are speed with a lightning bolt drawn on it and another saying happy birthday. I definitely wanted to run well for them and wanted to show them that hard work pays off and you can do anything if you're willing to put in the work. 
  When they blew the horn my watch was set and I hit play on my playlist that I had strategically organized to keep me pumped up. I had also made it 55 minutes long so I knew I needed to finish before it did.
   Half way through the race I was questioning what I was doing out here on a dirt road running? I realized I wasn't racing against my competitors, I was racing against myself. Being uncomfortable and pushing myself harder then when I trained my mind kept telling me I could slow down, I could walk if needed. I dug deep however and didn't give in to my thoughts, I pushed myself harder and kept telling myself I am speed. 
  Into my last mile my side was aching and legs were burning, I knew I could coast this last mile in 10 minutes and finish under an hour, but I wasn't running this race to coast. I wanted to push myself, I wanted to be uncomfortable. 
  With half a mile to go Til I Collapse by Eminem came on and I knew then I was about to go HAM. As I got closer to the finish line all I had left was a downhill into a short straight to the finish line. 
  Running down the hill I continue to speed up, giving it everything I had left. Flying down the hill I was at my top speed running the final stretch of road I soar past the finish line with a time of 48.59.
  Feeling exhausted and relieved, I knew I could run it in under an hour but I didn't know I could run it under 50 minutes. Sometimes we don't know what we're capable of until we test ourselves, sometimes we have to be uncomfortable to find out what we're capable of. 
  I finished 4th overall, 3rd out of the guys and 2nd in my age group. This is just the beginning of my running adventures and I look forward to being uncomfortable again so I can push myself beyond my limits.",First 10k!
running,"I am new to running and have decided to pick it up as a way to help get in shape. I’ve always despised it with some passion and was watching some videos on different ways of running to not get burnt out so fast and came across heart rate zone running, specifically finding your MAF rate and sticking to that. I’m 24 so my zone was 156, and essentially I read that my heart rate should never exceed 156 on my run. I tried this out and it went really well. I’m curious is anyone has any merit to this style of running?

running,"I am a cardio enthusiast and im working on the right pacing strategy to improve my long run timings. Running sites suggest breaking a 5K run into 3 splits and run flat out from the get go, however my interest here is to get a proper understanding of how the body clears lactate and delivers oxygen efficiently over time and running speed. I am more into longer distances but just quoting 5K here as an illustration.

Lets take 3 pacing strategies to run the 5K in 25:00 minutes:

Strategy 1 - Run even 1 km splits of 5:00 min each

Strategy 2 - Since my fastest 1K starting from rest is 4:25-4:30 min, how about doing the 4 initial 1K splits at 5:05 and push the final split at 4:40 min. In other words 7.3mph speed for 4 split, 8mph for Split 5 which is an increase of about 10%

Strategy 3 - Run uniformly increasing splits of 5:20, 5:10, 5:00, 4:50 and 4:40

Questions:

* Strategy 1 - as the body works aggressively to transport fuel in the 1st split, will it exhaust itself trying to clear considerable amounts of lactate? Is even split even sustainable for the duration of the race?
* Strategy 3 - Does the body get more efficient doing what it has to do at a steady and uniform increase in speed, compared to Strategy 2 which sees a sudden speed spike of 10%?

running,"  I have a lot going on health-wise. I am 55 years old male, about 50 pounds overweight. I have been running off and on since I was about 12, but I’ve never been fast at all. About 5 years ago or so I was able to do a ½ marathon at about a 10:30 pace.

About 6 weeks ago, I started to get in shape again. For diet, I cut the carbs, and started running.

In general, I am pretty pleased with my progress: I dropped about 12 pounds so far. I worked my way up to a 4 mile “long” run. I am happy with my progress with my endurance, and my legs are handling it well, but I am making no progress with speed. I have no delusions that I will ever be fast, but right now I am having difficulty breaking a 16 minute mile.

I think that part of the problem is that I just don’t have the gears available for an “easy” run. My runs average about 145 bmp, which is no where near a conversational pace and people are still passing me walking. Over the course of a 4 mile run, that is over an hour at almost 90% effort.

I can’t really run any slower. I don’t think walking would be as productive because I could (and sometimes do) walk all day without much fatigue. I guess I could add in walk breaks into my run to try to keep my heart rate lower, but that kinda feels like a step backwards since the only thing that I have to measure my progress is my endurance to run non-stop. I have started to add some strides to the end of my runs.

Again, I know that I will never be a fast runner. But at least I want to be able to hit a pace that is faster than walking. I’d be ecstatic if I could get to a 12 minute mile.  Any suggestions?",Having difficulty getting faster...

running,"Hello Everybody, 

I have been frequenting this sub Reddit and having recently taken up an interest in running. I have decided I am going to start doing 80/20 to see how quickly I can build up some base stamina and hopefully get my times faster without the amount of effort it currently does.

Just finished up my first 5k on this new programme and having unlocked Strava premium to see what zones I was in during the run I was wondering if I’m still going too fast (it feels really slow and it’s really odd even though my HR is up).

So according to Strava I spent the following amounts 

Zone1 0-126 - 0%
Zone2 126-157 - 7.7% 
Zone3 157-172 - 73.5%
Zone4 172-188 - 18.8% 
Zone5 &gt;188 - 0%

I admit for about half a KM I upped the pace and this is probably where that Zone 4 came from.

Average heart rate was 168bpm. 

I just find that even though my heart rate on my most part is in Zone3 it doesn’t feel like it’s tempo running. Should I just continue with it and see where it goes? 

I also want to increase my V02 max, my Apple Watch series 3 records it but I can’t tell how accurate it is, as it’s saying below average cardio which is probably right at 42 V02 max",80/20 4x5k per week
running,"So I am in a weird fase in my life. I am working on a great impact based food company that can be very successful. Because of the stress during covid, and me being from Amsterdam, I started smoking weed. Weed here is very high in THC and has zero CBD, which on the long term can cause brain fog, irritability and makes it harder to think. I also broke off a toxic relationship, which made me very chill. But now I know that if I want to succeed with my business,. I need to quit, so as of today I go cold turkey. This will give me withdrawal symptoms, and the best way of battling that is excersise.

I used to run in the sand dunes here in Holland, I was average nothing special, but I started to gain weight after I stopped running. It has been so long ago that I don't even know where to start. I am currently broke because I have invested a lot in the company, so I can't really buy equipment to assist me such as a Fitbit. 

Luckily I do have things going in my favor. I have acces to the world best food, algae, which is great antioxidant and has super nutrient dense, I can get that fresh since I grow it. My knowledge has increased immensely in what I need per day, it has brought me succes as I have lost a lot of weight. I went from 115 kg at sep 2021, to 99 kg as of today. 

This motivated me to start working out, since I achieved that goal with only changing my habits. I want to start running, I live near the Vondelpark, which is a very nice place to run. But something is stopping me, the weather is nice, I feel like shit and I know after a run I will feel great, but my body is not moving. Why? Because I know if will hurt, my back stings like crazy the first 3km, I am easily out of breath because I smoked, and I am fat with no good shoes, or clothing. 

I just need a lot of people to tell me to run, my love language is compliments, I know this sounds like fishing but this is just an ADHD guy, who is lonely building his dreams, and needs some redditors to tell him the truth and get him going. 

I need people as an extravert to be there bit along the way, just to start. After that I got this, I promise","This just got in: I am going to get the life I deserve, if I get my ass of this bed.."

\### Training - Garmin Connect HR marathon training plan - 16 weeks. 

I started running in August last year and have since worked my way up to the marathon. I competed in 10k, 12.5k events last year and half marathon event earlier this year. 

&amp;#x200B;

Training for marathon was quite hot and cold due to many injuries throughout. Initially patellofemoral issues in left knee, then ITBS in left leg, disk herniation in lower back and finally extensor tendonitis in right foot. So I would often get 1-2 weeks full training load in and then one of these would flare up and I would try to switch to cross training as best I could - some weeks I did not run a single KM, and instead had to mimic the training sessions on exercise bike or elliptical, running off heart rate. Eventually I sought help from a physio he educated me in what was likely causing my issues: usually drastic increase in weekly kms, drastic increase in training intensity (intense tempo days), not allowing for sufficient rest between hard sessions, and lack of strength training.

&amp;#x200B;

 Later in my training block I ironed all this out, structured my schedules better, allowed for proper rest, and did physio exercise every day as well as two structured strength days lifting weights in the gym a week. By the time marathon day came I was feeling excellent and had had some of my best weeks in training injury free and feeling really motivated. 

&amp;#x200B;

Training for this marathon was a gamechanger for me. This was what turned 'creating a habit' into a 'creating a new lifestyle' for me. It has been a challenge fitting in the long hours of training with working full time and being a father of two and a husband - but if I could train 7 days a week, I absolutely would. 

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

The days prior were pretty full on with the carb loading. I had trained carb loading for 2 days before long runs for several weeks and was tolerating that well in training, as well as using gels in those runs. But I carb loaded for 3 days before the marathon and that was a lot for me, I went to bed on race day eve feeling sick.

&amp;#x200B;

Race day morning was more food into a stomach that already felt full. 

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

I didn't fully commit to a goal time until 5 mins before the race. I had fallen on the sub 4 idea for weeks prior without actual crunching the numbers on that. The race predictions based off my previous events were putting my result at anywhere from 4:20 - 4:40 - these race predictors had previously been super accurate for me at other distances. However, another factor that made picking a race time hard was that I'd PRd all my previous race times in all races to date: so in my 12.5k race I'd beat my 10k PR, and in my HM I'd beat my 12.5 PR. So I knew I had been getting faster but wasn't sure if I'd plateaued yet.   

&amp;#x200B;

I used pacepro on my garmin for the marathon and decided to set it for 4:10. That way if things went well I could possible shoot for sub 4 or if they didn't I'd keep my more apprehensive race buddy happy (he was also a fellow 1st time marathoner). We'd hoped to come in under 4:30 which I knew to be the global average for men. 

&amp;#x200B;

We started off in the dark. It was thankfully overcast but not raining. The HM had been held the day before in the rain and there were plenty of horror stories circulating of the extreme chafe people copped. Our splits were coming up fast nearly every time until later in the race, despite trying to slow ourselves down. All the competitors were putting in a solid effort. 

&amp;#x200B;

We'd decided to put a lot of emphasis on the fuelling and water stops early on. I had it in my head that I would slow to an 'almost walk' every second stop to allow time to get in the water and electrolytes. As the race got on this stopping and starting get more and more punishing. After the 34k mark it was flat out a bad idea to be stopping and starting. 

&amp;#x200B;

The race had quite an impact on me mentally. I had run an excellent half marathon in training weeks prior, and I was so sure I was going to come into the marathon feeling exactly the same - I did not. I was mentally quite daunted for quite a while until I loosened up around 10k. Things were particularly difficult for me when I started to see the race leaders looping back on us. This race follows the esplanade of the coastline, so you go up a certain distance and then it turns around and you come back the way you came. So when I saw the runners coming back I was telling myself, 'soon you'll be turning around and coming back like they did.' I did eventually come back on their route but it wouldn't be for almost 15k. I was watching out for a buddy who is a lot faster who I knew would be looping back on me, so that distracted me for a while and that was good. 

&amp;#x200B;

By 28kms we started seeing a lot of runners stopping to walk, I felt grateful I wasn't in their shoes and still had fuel in the tank to keep running. The sun was out by now and optimism was increasing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I experienced more struggles later in the race when at the other end of the coastline when the race leaders again looped back on us. This time I was significantly more tired and it was at 32k onwards. I was quite literally yelling at one point, ""where the f\*$k do we turn around"" - I was not dealing with that.  

&amp;#x200B;

By 34ks our splits had decidedly slowed down and my body was feeling really stiff. Particularly my ankles were sore and my upper back and shoulders were super fatigued. Though our splits were behind we were actually still ahead overall - pacepro was showing we were ahead by 3 mins, so we had a little room for error there. Around this time we started seeing the odd runner down for the count on the side of the road. Each time they had helpers there, so we kept moving. It wasn't pretty. 

&amp;#x200B;

At km 39 I was feeling good as we'd finally looped back towards the last straight. I threw a cup of water over my head and war cried ""let's go!"" before sprinting out, thinking I'd caught a second wind. I ran that split at 5:12 compared to our average 5:50. It was easily the dumbest thing I'd done in the race. I of course fatigued and came dangerously close to meeting the dreaded 'wall'. My race buddy was understandably not happy and I don't blame him. I recovered though and we got back to a level pace. I begged him for the rest of the race not to sprint off on me because I wouldn't be able to catch him. We agreed we were crossing the finish line shoulder to shoulder. 

&amp;#x200B;

The rest of the race was the hardest. We didn't stop to walk, but our running style was not pretty by this point. Our friends met us near 40kms and cheered us on. That was awesome. I swear someone had moved the km markers further apart just to mess with us at the last part of the race. Never has 4km felt so long. At one point I'd forgotten a marathon was 42.2 km and in my head it was 41.1 - realising I had an extra km to go was the final torture. The crowd support at the end was phenomenal though. People packed in everywhere, the sound was louder than my headphones.  

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-race

I made it past the finish line, stopped my watch and found spot to the side to crouch down and just have a moment to let go and be vulnerable. It lasted about 8 seconds, I felt the weight of what I'd just done and I let myself just take that in... Then I told myself it was time to get up and keep moving or I'd seize up. I can't describe that moment very well but I think it was definitely a significant moment - I felt almost in an instant all the obligation of my life come back on me, and I knew I had to keep moving or risk freaking out. So strange, I worked my ass off for that moment. I'd thought about it, dreamt about it, talked about it non-stop for over 4 months, and I couldn't let myself savour it for more than 8 seconds because I didn't want to risk losing my momentum.

&amp;#x200B;

The first couple of days after the race were painful. Stairs were awful. My ITBS had flared right up, so had both my ankles, but everything in my body hurt really. Mentally I was very off, especially on day one. I don't think I felt depressed, but more just a bit lost, in a haze. I felt I had to really come up from the depths and pull the levers in my brain to make my body smile and communicate with people. I'm on day 3 now and feeling normal again. 

&amp;#x200B;

I didn't get my sub 4. My course time was 4:10:51. Strava had the actual marathon distance at 4:08:09. Overall the first marathon was a very significant experience. I felt it in my soul.

running,"I’m roughly 10 weeks into my marathon training plan and noticed that I am starting to gain weight. 

I’ve been running since the start of my twenties and for the past year or so started eating breakfast and a large late lunch (I sleep better if I don’t eat large amounts before bed). Throughout this time I have maintained a steady 10st or so. 

It’s only since increasing the distance that I have noticed I’m putting on weight. I’ve not reweighed myself because I’ve previously had an eating disorder, so I’m not mentally prepared to see that number yet. But my clothes are fitting differently and I feel uncomfortable in my skin again.

I am drinking more coffee and snacking on sweet things, because I’m more tired from the increased distance. But I don’t understand because I feel my energy expenditure is higher than my intake. 

Say for example (numbers are an estimate): 
Morning run -600cals, 
Breakfast: bran flakes  300cals
Late lunch: veg curry or pasta or veg wrap 600-800cals 
Afternoon snack: veg sticks and hummus 200cals
Evening: cup of tea and biscuits 200cals

I like waterproof because a portion of the trail I run on is grassy, which is always soaked with dew in the mornings.

Anyway, I was running downhill today and must’ve stepped in a hole or hit and uneven spot and rolled my ankle pretty badly. I’ve had it happen in the past where it just felt weird for a minute and I could keep going, but this time I knew right away I was going to be limping home.  So I limped about a mile back and  wrapped my foot and ankle up when I got home. Been icing it and trying to keep it elevated (not easy to do at work).

I want to run my first marathon in November with a 16 or 18 week training plan. I've been running 25-30 miles per week for a few months now, and my long run is 10 miles (\~8:45min/mile). I've seen a few threads on here about marathon training plans, but I want to avoid speed work because building mileage and including speed work sounds a little dangerous to me. Mostly when I've searched for novice plans I've seen Hal Higdon's plans come up, but his Novice 1 and 2 plans seem like a low weekly mileage with a large chunk of the mileage coming from the long run. His intermediate 1 plan seems better to me in terms of mileage and long run percentage, but the description also recommends against using the plan as a novice. Beyond Higdon, are there other plans I should consider that are geared towards a novice? Would two 20 mile training runs be too ambitious?

# Boston Marathon 

Here is our full **Boston video recap** [**https://youtu.be/f96FfDa9MU8**](https://youtu.be/f96FfDa9MU8) 

After qualifying way back in 2019, we finally got to run Boston in 2022! This is my second (and likely last) Boston. It was so nice to return especially on a year where the weather cooperated much more than it did in 2015. 

I had almost forgotten what an incredible race this is. The energy is overwhelming! We came to the race to have fun and celebrate being back at such an experience based race. And we did celebrate! We were enjoying dancing, giving high fives, taking beers, stopping for pictures, and soaking in the whole thing... which unsurprisingly led to a second half slump. 

While the crowd still cheered  and screamed like I was at a full sprint, my rookie mistake of using all my energy made the second half of the race sluggish and brutal. I had to work hard to ensure that I was still going to get as much enjoyment out of this race as possible regardless of pain. However, I also couldn't slow down too much because I foolishly scheduled my flight to Big Sur mid afternoon. 

Making sure I had time to eat and shower motivated me enough to arrive at the most iconic finish in marathoning with a 4 hour and 9 minute chip time. Not my fastest by a long shot... but also not my slowest either. I hobbled quickly through the chute, grabbed some snacks, and caught a ride to the hotel quickly! With little time to spare, my friends and I were on a plane that afternoon and heading across to country for the....

# Big Sur Marathon 

6 days later we were 3000 miles away on the opposite coast of the country in Big Sur! As we bussed down to the start line, I reflected that I really need to learn and respect where my limits are. I was still limping around from Boston and a mild case of plantar fasciitis had morphed into something more worrisome. 

Now wasn't the time for doubt though. I was at the start line for a race we originally signed up for in 2019. So no looking back now! This race was the antithesis of Boston. Small crowds, serene vistas, and stunning views of ragged edge of the western world. I see why this is considered one of the most scenic races ever.

I also planned to take this race slow, take pictures, and enjoy the views. I did just that but tried to learn from my mistakes at Boston. I took a smaller camera, kept a slower pace, and fueled better. We stopped often for photos and to enjoy the unique live music. The leisurely pace even made the dreaded hill of hurricane point relatively easy! My girlfriend and I finished the race together at 4 hours and 4 minutes this time and were thrilled to have seen such a one of a kind race in full. 

I'm still recovering even now. My feet didn't like the back to back races much. I'll be smarter in the future... but these 2 world class events was worth all the pain and PT that followed.

Current situation. Have been running (jogging) most mornings for a year, typically 4-5km outside. In 30 mins. I’d say it’s more of a mental health thing than training. Have bad pelvic floor which can impact hips — but seems ok if I do a little strength work. Have hectic schedule with work and kids, but can train before 7am everyday — although making time for weekly long run is actually pretty hard. Last week I did a sub 25 5km on a treadmill which felt so fast for me and I was so happy with, but then so impossible to maintain anything like that for a half! And even more impossible to do outside! I haven’t run more than 10km since before kids and I feel like I start to struggle as I go past the 6km mark.

running,"So I ran a half marathon today after a 24 week training cycle using Daniels Running Formula. I thought I would post my thoughts on the plan and my race.   


Training: Daniels plan is divided into 4 phases. I was extremely out of shape and greatly appreciated phase 1, which basically tells you to pick your weekly mileage, and then do easy miles for 6 weeks, just getting used to that weekly volume. The actual workouts start on week 7 with phase 2. Six weeks in phase 1 was plenty to get used to my chosen weekly mileage of 30 mile weeks. 

This was a high mileage for me, but at first seemed very low for this training plan. Some of the workouts are based on weekly mileage and seemed short - it seemed to be geared towards 40+ miles per week. For example, the long runs were up to 25% of your weekly mileage, and at first this seemed to mean I would never run over 7.5 miles when training for a half. 

What I found later is several workouts were far longer than that, they just weren’t labeled long runs. For example, one had you do tempo repeats and by the time all your repeats were finished, you had ran 12 miles. I got in several runs over 10 miles during training. 

Phase 2 consisted of a lot of 200 and 400m repeats. I did question whether this was a proper half-marathon training as I cranked out many 200m intervals over phase 2, but I trusted the plan and followed it exactly. Phase 3 was the hardest, as he states in the book, and by the time phase 4 came around, I was very glad to ease off the phase 3 workouts. Phase 4 felt like a 6 week taper with plenty of long slow runs, a few tempo runs and basically no speed work.  


My A goal for this half was sub-1:50, and my B goal was to beat my PR of 1:52:xx.

The race weather today was a great temp for the first hour, and slightly warm for the second but I don’t think that affected my performance. The course was mostly flat but there were a couple of hills that certainly added to the course difficulty.  

I ended up running a 1:50:00.8 which I am going to say met my A goal, even though I was over by 0.8s! I also won my age group with that time, and it is the first time I ever won my age group, so I have no complaints. Daniels Running Formula did a good job preparing me.   


One final thing I’ll say about DRF is it has you run every day. The easy days are easy, but you lace up 7 days a week. If that doesn’t appeal, you would have to either modify the plan or choose a different one. Even at age 53 and starting the plan out of shape, I stayed injury-free even running 7 days a week. This is even having never trained 7 days a week before. Overall, I recommend it! Thanks for reading.",Daniels Running Formula half marathon race report

running,"Is there an official tshirt I get for having my first ""i'm a dumbass"" running moment? New runner, core sport is endurance cycling (which makes this post even dumber). Had my first BONK today (never even had one during any century ride) and it was brutal. My running/cycling coach gave me a target of 8-8.5 mile run at an ""easy"" pace. I had a Clif bar 45 minutes prior, started running at 9:30am. Had 1 gu pack at 5 miles, 1 liter of electrolytes in a hydration vest. I figured that was plenty for a 90 minute max run.

Um, nope. I didn't bring any ""contingency"" snacks. No honey stingers nor extra gu. At 6.5 miles I had a weird feeling. At 7.5 miles I started going downhill. At 7.8 miles I had to sit down on a bench cuz light headed. I muscled to 8.5 miles to get a distance PR, then threw in the towel and walked the remaining half mile home. My legs were ""fine"", I couldn't trust my brain to see sidewalk issues / root damage and move out of the way while I was running.  

After an iced coffee and a piece of cake I felt confident enough to shower. It's been 2.5 hours and I'm just now feeling okay.

I'm honestly grateful this occurred so I know to bring extra fuel. I'm doing the SF (half) marathon in 3 weeks, better to understand my limits now than in the middle of a stupidly expensive event.

running,"Hey guys, I am hoping to lean on some experienced runners for some support in deciding if I should shoot for sub 3 in my next marathon in 16 weeks. I was actually going for sub 3 on my first marathon last year but picked up and injury just after mile 20 and had a DNF. My inexperience was exposed on this race as it was a very hot day and I picked out a race that had many hills, if I was to go back in time I would have scrapped the sub 3 pace I trained for and taken it easier but had to take a hard lesson. Injury wise I struggled for a few months, I got back to training in mid December after 5 weeks off and managed a 3:08 in Manchester in April, this was with no speed work in six months and a bit of a “see how you feel”. I ran 7:10 miles comfortably up until around mile 22, it got tough near the end but I held out for the 3:08 and to be honest, I was and am still very proud of that time with the injury’s and time off. 

I would say I’m not close to being as fit as I was 12 months ago, but maybe not as far off as what I sometimes think, but I’ve lost a lot of confidence. I ran my first half marathon race last week on a very hilly route with bad head winds in 1:28:06, being honest I had a lot left in the tank and tried to use it as experience as I’ve never raced a half before, I only started running at the start of the pandemic when everything was cancelled so I’m still learning and I just didn’t want to gas out. On a flat course I feel I could hit maybe a minute less. 

I fully admit I’m slightly strange in how my body works and recovers, a few people laughed at me and said I was stupid when I said I did a 21 mile long run at marathon pace and that I couldn’t run my marathon at that pace, but I did because I knew they wasn’t my full effort pace and that I just wanted to finish the race as I was coming back from the injury. 

I know a lot of the time the 1:25 half time is given as a rough goal to make a sub 3 achievable and I actually have a half marathon in London in September. My main questions is, would you train at sub 3 times and effort and if I go under 1:25 in the half then shoot for a sub 3 in my marathon, or would you say that’s too much of an ask in 16 weeks no matter what?

When I try to do tempos I'll be sprinting like crazy only to check my watch and have it finally refresh my distance and realize I've well passed 800m.

I want a new watch that I don't have to charge daily and will help me run some different kinds of workouts. I'm looking at the Forerunner 55 or 245 or the Coros Pace 2. 

Here's ideally what I want - pace readouts during my run that will tell me if I'm above or below a planned pace.  I don't understand training metrics, nor do I really care to. I run a 5k 4 days a week for fun. I mix it up if I'm feeling crazy.  Maybe I'll get into something different if I can rely on my watch to tell me when to start and stop intervals. 

It seems like the Pace 2 only buzzes and doesn't have audio feedback?  Isn't it annoying to have to check the screen constantly to see how your pace is?  
And do the Forerunners tell you how you are compared to a goal pace?

Anyway, I told a good friend about doing 8miles/2hours today and my friend honestly asked me with a straight face if I walked it because that's kinda slow lmao. Is 8 miles in 2 hours not really, really good? His argument was that he could do 3 miles in 18-22 minutes which I could probably do that too in around 25 minutes but my argument was that no ones 2nd half of an 8 mile run is going to be nearly as fast as the first 3-4 miles were.

Also just about everyone's is going to have to take 20-30 minutes to walk on an 8 mile right? Like there are very few people who can run 8 miles continuously at the same pace all in one go - I mean, there are people who can't even walk that lol.

As a runner, it appears that creatine, in my opinion, does and does not make sense to take on face value. I can understand arguments from both sides, however I'd love to hear from someone who has actually taken creatine while running.

running,"Hey folks,

&amp;#x200B;

Sorry if this question was already adressed (or if it's considered as ""medical question""), but I've started again to make some run and, using a Garmin Venu 2, I'm a bit worried about what my heart rate is saying. 

&amp;#x200B;

So basically I'm not a huge sport man, I'm just trying to achieve a 5 km run in less than 30'. I used to do that 15 years ago (10km in &lt;1 hour) and I just want to retrieve some of this old ""performance"". However, my heart rate is sky high when I'm running, going from 70-80 (rest) to 90-100 (quick walking/warming up) and then when I start the run I go quickly to 170, reaching finally &gt;185 bpm after 5-10' of run. 

2 days ago, I also tried to include ""resting"" section while aiming 6'/km for one km on running section (kind of ""Run-Walk-Run"" approach). During the ""high running phases"", I even reached &gt;200 bpm. 

I know that these watch are not 100% precise, but among one run, they should be ""relatively"" correct right? So if I'm going from 80 to 200 bpm, does it mean that my heart rate is shy high quickly? I precise that I managed to do 3 times the following: 1km at &lt;6.15'/km followed by 1.15' walk. I could probably do one repeat more, so I was not completely burned. 

Also, these high heartbeat were given by two different watches, so I doubt that there is malfunction...

&amp;#x200B;

Anyway: **Should I be worried?** Maybe I'm kind of hypochondriac here, but if my heart does not stand exercice, it would be nice that I'm noticing it :D. Should I make some test or is this something perfectly normal and I should continue my training?

So... I'm a college student, and I've been witnessing my fitness levels drop, so I'm thinking of buying a manual treadmill for many reasons, mainly:

\- low cost compared to motorised ones

\- does not consume electricity

\- slim and small, does not consume space

\- apparently produces less noise, so less disturbing the neighbours in the floor below me

\- challenging and builds endurance

\- less damaging to knees and heels

running,"Hello,

I started running a few months ago, and with very poor judgement I decided to run a half-marathon. I was able to finish it, but I believe that was the worse mistake.

I went to a doctor, but not a specialized one, and nothing was broken. With what I read online, it was probably plantas fasciitis. I stopped running for almost 2 months, and in the first 2-3 weeks applied ice, did massages and stretching. I've felt no pain, even after hiking 20km. But sometimes I think I feel some pain or discomfort, but I think it's just of being scared, like a ghost pain if that makes sense.

But I've no idea how cured it is. In the past week I've ran 1k, 2k and then 4k with a rest day in between. The foot seems ok, but I'm extremely concerned. I've searched online, and it seems the recommendation to a beginner is to run 3-4x per week, for about 30 minutes (which for me is about 4-5km).

Is this a good plan? Is it better to run more days less time or the 30m per day is ok? Like every day 15 minutes with a day off per week. I do bike at least 3x per week and have integrated some strength training (though no elasticity training).

Would you wait more time? Then how should I increase distance? I wanted to do a sub 2h half marathon in the near future.","Starting to run after injury, still as a beginner"

I am in need of some advice, it's been years that I experience this. Every time I do a cardio exercise, I experience these symptoms:

* Throbbing sudden headache in the back of my head
* Nausea
* Dizziness 
* Sensitivity to light

These do not always happen with running, but I can almost every time trigger these symptoms with a 10-15 minute run (or even cardio in the gym).

Yesterday the same thing happened, I was okay (just a really really far mild headache) and I headed home from the beach (7 minute walking - unfortunately under the sun). I had a hat and sunglasses and by the 3-4 minute mark, there you go I was having an headache. These headaches then require to sit in an AC cooled room, take an ibuprofen and stay still for 30-40 mins to cool down, then they go away.

Do you guys think this is heat exhaustion? I mean in the gym, it's kinda cooled (i still get crazy hot while doing cardio). 

I can trigger the same symptoms for a longer run in the winter, but not as fast as in the summer, so the sun is definitely involved as a trigger, but then again same thing happens in the gym, inside. 

I go to the beach frequently because I live near it and it's really starting to affect my life in general, by the time lunch-time comes, my friends are all drinking beers and alcohol and there I am experiencing each time the worst headaches in my life.

### Training
Earlier this year at the Sydney Morning Herald Half Marathon 2022 (15 May), I had achieved a new PB of sub-100 minutes. Prior to that, I had a PB of sub-105 at the ASICS Half Marathon 2018. Knowing that the ASICS Half Marathon was a much flatter course, I set sub-95 minutes as my goal. (This meant I would need to maintain a pace of 4:30/km.)

My general training programme remained pretty much unchanged from what I did for the SMH race: rest on Mondays and Thursdays, intervals (e.g. pyramid, km repeats, mile repeats) on Wednesdays, and anywhere between 8–16km @ easy pace on the other days.

For my final interval session 10 days before the race, I was able to hold a 4:10/km pace for 5 sets of mile repeats. That was certainly a confidence boost as I started tapering.

### Pre-race
Flew up from Sydney with a friend (who got sub-87) on Thursday and we rented a hotel that was about 25 minutes away via light rail. The next morning we had a 5k shakeout run, and went to the race expo for all the standard stuff. After lunch we spent the afternoon chilling and I decided to have a warm bath to loosen up.

That night we each had a Subway footlong to avoid introducing anything new to our diets. This friend also mentioned what happened to the winner of the 2019 Gold Coast Marathon, so I made sure to have band-aids ready for my nipples.

I was able to get about 6 hours of sleep, which I consider to be pretty good. Unfortunately, my friend was rather restless and joked that my snoring kept him up. I don't eat before morning runs, even for races, so I just drank some water and we headed off to the race venue to do our warm-up. Before we knew, it we were on the course waiting for the gun to go off.

### Race
""On your marks!"" \*bang\*

Almost right away, I wished the course had bottlenecked the start line similar to what the SMH Half Marathon did. It took about 2 km before everyone was spaced out enough for me to comfortably run at 4:30 pace. I found myself looking around for runners to pace with, a tactic I found to be pretty useful from my SMH race.

At about 6k in, a runner asked for assistance tearing open their energy gel. The packet was quite slippery so I asked, ""do you mind if I use my teeth?"" They replied with a ""yes"" so I was quite confused and assumed they meant ""no"". I was able to rip the top off just as we were coming up to the hydration station which I had planned to skip. For some reason I decided to reach for a cup at the last table but missed, and the genius in me decided to turn around to try again! I suspect this move cost me a sub-94 finish, so it'll definitely be an important lesson to learn from.

At about 9km in, someone who was already on the return (the course u-turns at 11km) recognised my military formation singlet and shouted our formation name, to which I shouted back appropriately. This happened again about 10 minutes later, and both instances gave me a decent morale boost for the rest of the race as I called upon the mental fortitude from my period in service.

I started to feel some fatigue about 13km into the course, which naturally worsened as I kept on running. Fortunately, I had already found someone to keep pace with, so I just kept my head up and put one foot in front of the other. My accuracy in grabbing cups at the hydration stations had also drastically improved.

Finally, after a gruelling final 2 kilometres, I approached the home stretch. There were crowds gathered to my left in the stands cheering us on, but I kept my gaze laser-focused on the road ahead. As I passed under the 250m arch, I found myself going into a bit of a sprint. Passing at least 10 runners, I hear the announcer/emcee point out that the gun time was approaching 1:35:00. There was no way I could have made it, but I still gave it one final push and crossed the finishing arch.


### Post-race
I grab myself 3 orange slices, 2 banana halves, 2 cups of electrolytes, and a water bottle before proceeding to pick up my finished tee and medal. I met up with my friend, took a few photos, and we headed off for a celebratory lunch at O Bagel.

My next major event will be the Blackmores Sydney Running Festival. If I go for the half marathon event, I might try aiming for sub-93 minutes. If it's the full, I'll go for the sub-4 hours which eluded me in my last attempt.

Even if there's room to run I know I will self-conscious out there and would rather have fewer rather than more of those experiences. 

My basic question is: what's the minimum I can do, while I'm there, to not lose any (or not lose much) conditioning? So that I can pick up where (or nearly where) I left off, when I return? (Or maybe I'll be too jet-lagged on my first day back, so it will really be 11 days?)

running,"
Hi All, 

Within the last year I have started running for a variety of reasons, general fitness, mental well-being, etc. 

To date I have a total of 152KM in 32 runs, generally do 5Ks with the odd 10K mixed in. 

I was wondering what I should be doing to improve my times and also my overall cardio. 

To provide some more context, my personal best 5k was 25:12 with an average HR of 181 and the max being 192, which is extremely close to my maximum heart rate of 194 (often times at this pace I stay in the 190s for an extended period). I read that staying near 100% MHR is generally a bad thing and can lead to problems with injury and obviously more severe problems with your heart.

I can comfortably keep an average heart rate of 173bpm at a slower pace at 30 minutes for a 5k where my max HR only reaches 184. I generally feel a lot better after a run like this, often when I was going flat out I’d feel lightheaded and a bit rough for 10-15 minutes after.

Should I be focusing on keeping my Heart rate between 50-85% during my runs as I have read on a number of sites? Is this going to improve my general cardio fitness and in the long run lead me to get quicker times when running? Or do I need to incorporate some speed training/interval training? 

I was planning on doing slower 5ks around the 30 minute mark but more frequently, something like 3-4 times a week.",5ks for a beginner
running,"I’m 33 and I have been jogging on and off for the last decade but never got serious about it. It was mostly for pleasure. No routine, no consistency, zero knowledge but somehow also zero injuries. Until recently, I didn’t even know how relevant cadence is. I did a 5k, 10k and 20k once just to see if I can (I could but it was miserable).

My best 5k was a tad below 29 minutes a long time ago. Yesterday, I ran the distance a little above 32 minutes. I’ve been doing a training program with Garmin to pace myself.

I’d like to get more serious about jogging and set myself particular goals. I’m starting to read more about it and explore. Right now the immediate goal is to get below 30m 5k but I’m not sure what should be next. 

I was thinking about:
- 10k under 1h 
- 5k under 27m

I have been running consistently for most of this year, 3 to 4 runs per week, 10 to 20 miles per week. Through all of this, I have consistently struggled with my first 2ish miles of each run. I have heard people mention to ""never judge a run during the first mile"" but for me, it seems to take quite a bit longer than that to get going. 

&amp;#x200B;

During the first few miles I feel like crap. My body aches, my form feels poor, and I just generally do not feel like I am running well. After the 2 or 3 mile mark, my body comes to life. During my last 10k, my run went something like this: Miles 1 and 2, I felt slow and lethargic. Miles 3, I started to get into my groove a bit, but still worried I wouldn't be able to run the whole thing. Then from mile 4 to the finish, I felt incredible and had limitless energy. During that 10k, I was able to achieve my fastest splits during miles 4 and 5 to the end with lots of energy to spare. I was like a gazelle at the end of the race, but at the start I felt like a sloth.

running,"TLDR: Ankle rolling more than it used too (circa 2018); changed shoes from NB Fresh Foam 1080 to Brooks Ghost 14 and still issue. Thinking it’s bio mechanical and not shoe related. Any tips?

The Long Read: Let me start with in planning to consult my orhto MD and podiatrist but wanted to get some thoughts here as well.

I’ve started training for the NYCM and noticed that when I run on bridle paths throughout NYC that my right ankle is rolling much often than it used too (I ran the NYCM in 2018 and that was the last time I did any serious running). I had surgery in 2019 on my right knee to repair a torn meniscus but didn’t notice any rolling issues when I’d run after that. With the pandemic I got lazy and didn’t run as consistently as I did before and worked from home (so no commuting). Another way to describe it is if I hit a patch of uneven terrain my shoe stays in place and my foot feels like it’s “rolling over” the edge of the shoe.

Shoe wise I was rubbing in NB 1080s and thought it was the insane amount of cushioning that wasn’t providing enough support. Switched to Brooks Ghost 14s on the recommendation of the Fleet Feet folks here in NY but am having the same issue (though my foot feels more stable). I train and ran the NYCM in 2018 in the Nike Pegasus (35s?) and did not have any issues (training consisted of street running and bridle/dirt path running).

Just curious if anyone has had the same issue coming off of a long break running?    Should I consider inserts or just changing shoes? I tried a newer iteration of the Pegasus and didn’t like them. Is this a strength issue, ie strengthening leg muscles (ie abductors) or other workouts for ankle stability?

running,"I'm having a holiday with a group of friends in two weeks. It has become a bit of a tradition for me to go there on bike, but it doesn't feel as challenging anymore. So, I thought about running (part) of the route.

Waking up early and taking public transport would bring me 75-kilometre from my destination at 08:45 AM. Running the first 27k at a 5:00 min/km (12 km/hour) pace would get me to the ferry by 11:00 AM. At this point, I would have some 45 minutes of downtime at the pier and on the boat. The final 50k starts at 11:45 AM. My pace won't be so good at this point, but I believe (!) 6:00 min/km (10km/hour) is a conservative but reasonable estimate. I would also take a 15-minute break every hour. According to these estimates, the 50 kilometres would take me 6 hours. I would arrive at my destination at 5:45 PM.

Here is the thing. I have never done anything like this. Perhaps my estimates are all wrong. Perhaps my body will quit on my after 50k. Luckily, I don't have to arrive before 6 PM. Getting there 2 hours later doesn't make a big difference. Also, my friends will go there by car and they would be able to pick me up if I do fail.

### Training
I had no real hard and set training plan going into the half marathon. I have only started getting seriously into running this year. For some background of my running journey, I ran the International Women's Day 5k Fun Run in 2019 And 2021 with times of 00:30:12 and 00:29:06 respectively. In late 2019 I underwent ACL reconstruction surgery so running was a no go for a while. 

Fast forward to 2021 where I got interested in running due to rehab and getting my fitness back after surgery. I was very inconsistent during that year running a couple times a week for a couple months then not running for a month or two and that just went on for the year. 

In 2022 I started to do parkruns and reading more on how to structure my runs each week (easy runs, speed work, long run), in the two months leading up to the half marathon I was running ~30 km per week and had been smashing PB's with a current 5k PB of 00:23:30 at a parkrun and 10k PB of 00:51:01 which was done at the Brisbane Marathon. More or less I just tried to run 3-4 times a week with mostly easy runs and one long run.

### Pre-race
I drove to the Gold Coast from Brisbane and took me almost 2.5 hrs due to traffic and stayed overnight so that I would not have to make the travel in the morning as the race started at 6am and I could get a chance for a decent sleep. I was feeling a bit rushed the morning of the race trying to get to the venue, i didn't get a proper run warmup, the warmup just ended up being a job from our team tent to the start line, and forgot one of my energy gels. Because I was rushing a bit, my mind got a bit jumbled and I forgot about finding the 1:50, plan was to stay just ahead of him and if he ever passed me I knew I was not staying within pace.

### Race
Race started in the dark with a little bit if rain, was not raining hard but just a very light drizzle. I actually thought conditions were good, it was not cold and didn't get hot by the end of the race, and the light rain felt like it kept me at a perfect temperature. 

Because I had forgotten my plans of finding the pacer, I went and just ran at what felt to be comfortable pace. Not trying to go too hard as this was my first half marathon and also not knowing what pace I could hold for that distance. Luckily that comfortable pace would get me close to my target time but not under. The run actually felt good throughout until I got to the 19km mark and looked at my watch and saw that my goal time looked to be in jeopardy if I kept the same pace I had been running so I picked up the pace the last two kilometres.

### Post-race
Finished the race, got some bananas and electrolytes. Picked up my finisher shirt and my medal for completing the half marathon. Feeling just a little sore, stiff and tight post run but nothing bad.

Now I'm looking forward to maybe getting another half marathon this year and doing the Gold Coast again as a full marathon next year.

running,"I am 31M, I do run on and off about three years now. However, this year I wanted to take running on a more serious level. Currently, I can do 5:20 for 5K and 6:00 for 10k. Last year I did 53:00 on a 10k race which was my PB. Currently, I run 80-100 KM in a month.

\- Currently I run for about 35-40 km/week. I would like to start the plan around this mileage or a bit above it and slowly increase it.   
What I am looking for in a plan:  
\- No hill sessions (I live in a very flat area, so this is impossible for

\- 4 or 5 workouts / week

### Training
I ran my first Parkrun at the start of the year. I've never enjoyed running but I play soccer and wasn't fit enough last year. The atmosphere at parkrun was so good and I was kinda hooked. Went to a few Parkruns and kept improving my time. Then I thought, if I can do this. Why not go for a bigger goal? I downloaded Hal Higdon's Half Marathon training plan for beginners, chose a Half Marathon about 4 months away and signed up for the Gold Coast Half. 

The first bit of training went really well (since I had some base fitness). Then Covid hit the household and I wasn't able to run for a week. I followed the plan quite well but had to adjust it a bit since doing 3/4 runs a week and playing soccer didn't go that well together (for me at least). So each week I skipped one run for a soccer game. Regrettably I didn't do the hill/pace training in the program but just completed the distance instead. 
The last few weeks before the race I didn't run much since my foot was a bit sore. I don't think the goal of a sub 2hr half marathon was realistic considering I didn't do much pace training but it was good to have a ""hard"" goal.

### Pre-race
The Gold Coast is a 3.30 hr drive from where I live, we left early the day before to pick up my number and have a look at the expo and go to the start of the race. Unfortunately it took 6,5 hrs, due to traffic, to get there so I couldn't go to the start of the race anymore. Went to bed at 8pm since the race would start at 6. Slept quite okay, had some pre race nerves and couldn't eat much. 

### Race
It was dark and rainy, luckily not very cold. I started quite slow. Since I had never ran a half marathon before I started in one of the last starting zones. My goal was to run with the 2:10 pacers and then look for the 2hr pacers. 
I was a bit behind the 2:10 pacers and I didn't caught up to them until the 5k mark. I ran with them for a bit and then went off to look for the 2hr pacers. I think until the 13k I ran really solid, I then realized I wouldn't make it sub 2hrs. During the whole race I didn't see the 2hr pacers once. I had gels at the 5k and 11k mark. I tried to keep going but around the 17k mark my body just felt so heavy. It was hard to keep my legs moving. There was a lot of support on the course which helped a lot. At the 20k mark I stopped running for maybe 20 meters and then I thought to myself:  ""I'm so close, RUN haha."" The last kilometer and a bit I really got lifted by all the people on the side. My partner was right before the finish line and I managed to finish in 2:04:46. 

### Post-race
Picked up my medal and shirt, found my partner and went off to have some breakfast. The journey home was much faster luckily. Today my legs feel very sore. Already thinking about the next half and next year I'll sign up for the full marathon. 
Absolutely loved the race. I think if I do some pace training I'll be able to run a sub 2hr marathon. I'm hooked.

running,"Hello good folks,

  
I am a longtime hiker (30F) who really doesn't really enjoy running unless it's going downhill on a trail.  
After a period of doing not too much exercise due to life things, I am trying to train for a long day hike/run (\~30km, 3800m elevation gain) in about six weeks-I have something I have been wondering for a few years and would love to hear your knowledge on.

I have been doing brisk hikes/trail runs \~2 times a week (\~1hr long), with one day of doing laps on a steep hike. I know that training in zone 2 is supposed to be the bread and butter for building cardiovascular endurance, but I have been noticing that my heart rate goes through the roof when I do these activities, staying often in zone 3-5. I can sustain this for long periods as well (for example I can sustain 150\~180 bpm (Zone 4\~5) over a 3 hour period, covering \~6.2km distance and \~1800m elevation gain). Does the heart rate being high just mean that I'm not fit?

Is primarily doing hikes (and jogging the flats/downs) an okay way to build up endurance for hiking and trail running? Do I *have* to incorporate long runs in Zone 2/could my ""non-training plan training plan"" be improved?

running,"So a few months ago i contributed to this community by sharing my knowledge as someone who has been coaching track and field in Jamaica for over a decade now...

There were lots of comments that cleared up some stuff for people, provided confirmation for some and helped some get a better understanding to their questions/issues.

But then a few reached out to me privately and asked more personal longer, detailed questions.

Some of these comments and questions stuck with me over some time now and i want to again provide some info that might help.


Let me get straight to the point..


Some might be trying to improve their running time/speed with very little to no success.

Some have to admit that their lack of progress stems from inconsistency in training... But others stick with it and still can't improve. 

You try a bunch of things... But, you're  not improving (or at the rate you would like)

...... So you try other programs
.....You even try or consider training harder
....You try different diets
.....You try to change your running form/mechanics
.....You try to change your breathing patterns
.....You try different sleeping patterns
....Even recovery and or running supplements
.....Some people even try different running shoes
.....You even try some stretching exercises
.....You try meditation

.....All of this WILL HELP... but if you want FAST consistent improvements in running economy irrelevant of diet, stressful mental focusing exercises, hard to control and keep up with breathing exercises.... then just get better performing hips... Its as simple as that. 

I am not bashing any of the above... i am just trying to be dead plain simple and straightforward based on what consistently works for everyone right across the board. 

So what is ""Hip Efficiency""? 

In simple terms its the ability of the hips to give you consistent better running performances by efficiently transmitting forces generated by each foot strike on the ground to propel you forward faster with minimal waste of energy. 

So your mind might go to hip thrust exercises... well, thats just a part of it.

The main muscles at play when running are the muscles that perform hip extension..

These are:

- The semimembranosus
- Semitendinosus
- Bicep femoris
- Glute maximus
- Glute minimus
Etc...

If you do not train these muscles adequately, and appropriately... 

You will continue to pay a heavy price regarding your running economy...","If you REALLY want to run faster... ""Hip Efficiency"" is your answer.."

running,"I have my sights set for a half marathon scheduled for October 1st. The problem is I've only picked running back up in the past couple weeks. I used to be an avid runner and a half marathon would have been nothing before. I was honestly stunned by how out of shape I was. It has only been three years since I stopped but I am struggling to run just 3 miles. 

&amp;#x200B;

I have seen a lot of people on here say they just jumped in and worked there way to a 5K or 10K. Does it seem realistic to get to the point of a half marathon by October 1st?

### Training
I started to really enjoy running in 2019 and 2020, doing couch to 5k and then 5k to 10k before being stopped by a hip flexor injury that I couldn't shake. I tried physio, different shoes and stretches but every run past 5k would leave me almost unable to raise my left leg. I stopped running for about 18 months, with a few failed attempts to start without injury. After a mentally rough end to 2021, I was determined to get back to running as I knew what a difference it made to my mood.

I started watching YouTube videos about different hip stretches and training couch to 5K again in early January. I was determined to take it slow and avoid re-injury. The stretches I was doing seemed to help and I wasn't having as much pain. When it really clicked was finding [The Myrtl Routine](https://runnyday.in/myrtl-routine/). I started doing this after every run and my hip pain disappeared after two weeks. I completed C25K and felt as though I could push myself. A colleague mentioned the Clontarf Half-Marathon and something about the idea of pushing past where I had reached before pre-injury really excited me.

I used the ""Run with Hal"" app ([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/run-with-hal-training-plans/id1437166081), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.peaksware.labs.halbot&amp;hl=en_IE&amp;gl=US)) to build a training plan from that date to the race date (12 weeks). I thought the app was great, the feedback loop of entering how each training run was and getting feedback was effective. I ran 4x a week; a recovery run, 2x base runs and a long run at the weekend. I missed a couple of runs due to illness and a light bout of Covid, but thankfully I was able to jump back into where I was supposed to be without any setbacks.

Aside from running I also walked daily, usually 3-5km just to get out of the house.

### Pre-race
I tried to eat a lot of carbs and sleep well during race week. The day before, I ate a lot of pasta, chicken and other carb-y goods but avoided anything sugar-y for fear of heartburn. I got up early on race day and had a shower. I ate a toasted bagel with chicken, had a cup of coffee and did some light stretching. I sipped on a water bottle with a Nuun in it on the way to the race and then found my place between the pacers. I had downloaded a long podcast episode that I thought would keep me amused, which it did.

### Race
The route goes out and back along a stretch of the Dublin coast. There's a small island off the coast called Bull Island, connected by a bridge. The course went along the coast to that bridge, onto the island, along some treated sand, off the island back onto the coast and then turn around and come back.

I set off just ahead of the 2 hour pacers and made sure to start slowly. The first few km flew by and I was onto the bridge pretty quickly. We ran along the path of Bull Island and then turned left down onto the treated sand at the 5km mark. The sand was treated but was still sand. It felt like 5% of every foot strike was going down and back into the sand, which was really tiring. Bizarrely, I was overtaken by the 2 hour pacers at this point and then ended up significantly ahead of me. I was confident in my pacing on my watch so I held back and decided to just get through the beach part, which I think was about 2/3 km long. At the end of the beach area was a fun surprise, which was untreated sand for about 200m before getting back onto road. Absolute murder on my calves and knowing I had to come back to it later was demoralising.

Once I got back on tarmac, I was flying. I think the beach really took it out of people who ran too fast. I quickly caught back up to the 2 hour pacers and overtook them. I continued to pass people while checking I wasn't going too hard. There was a lot of road before hitting the turnaround point. At about 14km I was starting to feel tired and was dreading the sand that I knew was coming later. Luckily, there was a crowd at this spot and a load of kids wanted high-fives, which was a real boost to my energy and mood. Some were tiny and I had to be careful not to high-five too hard and knock them over!

I had the good sense to pack a Nutrigrain bar in my flipbelt, which I ate before the end beach stretch as I was starting to get really hungry. I went past a water station and grabbed a bottle, drinking most of it and pouring some on my face. I thought this would be refreshing but it was a big mistake, it just washed a load of sweat into my eyes which made them sting like crazy.

I hit the end beach stretch, which seemed to take it out of people - there were more people stopped or walking at this point than at any other stage of the race. It was an absolute slog and you can see how far you have to go the whole time. Once I was off the beach, I was feeling good and felt the end was near (of the race, not me). I ran pretty hard for the last 2km and crossed the line.

### Post-race
I hadn't looked at the time on my watch through the race, only my pace. After saying hi to my family, I remembered to stop my workout activity and was shocked to see that it was at 01:52. That was way faster than I had expected to be able to run it. I caught my breath, grabbed a water and banana, then headed over to my family. We took a couple of photos and drove home.

When I was home, I did my Myrtl Hip Routine and had a shower. I had a burrito delivered, which I devoured before having a nap for an hour or two. I got up, went for a quick walk to stop my legs from getting too stiff and sat down to write this! I'm going to take a week or two off before deciding whether to target another half marathon or start slowly training for a full one.

running,"I'm in the middle of training for the Santa Rosa Marathon at the end of August. Searching briefly, it looks like a relatively flat course with a total elevation gain of a little over 400 ft.

On my 14 miles this morning I did 764, I believe on the 18 miler in a couple weeks that gets up to 1000 ft. of climbing. 

&amp;#x200B;

I kind of had it figured in my head that if I could run the distances with all the climbing the flat would be easier/faster by comparison. My PT brought up that I might want to switch to a flatter route on my long runs to practice holding race pace closer to what I'll be seeing on the course. I could do this by driving 10 or 12 miles to a different part of the same bike path instead of starting from my front door.

Today, I was able to jog with my dog and there was no pain until I came back and the adrenaline died down along with the excitement (both at being able to run and having successfully coaxed my dog to go on a walk). The pain wasn't bad, I'd say a weird throwing 2.5/10.

I also randomly lose strength in my knee (especially if I'm jogging) such as a few times when I run or crossing the street or stairs. It just buckles and THIS is painless, most of the time.

I went to the doc once for an xray. They sent me home with a ""you're fine,no issues!"" No swelling. Nothing. And now, I have no more insurance and fearing a future with an inability to walk, let alone run. I'm 26 and already death gripping rails when going down stairs. Is this it? No more being active?

running,"I started running 4 months ago, am little overweight and terribly out of shape. My progression went from being able to run 2km to running 10k@1:15h in about 3 months and progression seemed good. After that run, I had worst runs in few months and couldnt even do a 5km run without having to walk. I took 6 days off to recover and still next run wasnt able to run 5km. I took again many days off and had to really force myself to keep running in a 7km run to finish it when first time ran that distance was few months before and it wasnt that bad and I had ran that distance once a week multiple times after that. I was losing motivation, I wasnt progressing. I was supposed to increase my long run like 10% each week, but even shorter runs felt really bad.

Then I got heart rate monitor and researched LTHR, HRmax, HRR etc and decided to do an LTHR test and run based on my heart rate zones.

And after looking at my heart rates I understood. All my runs have been probably at zone4/zone5. I thought I was running at somewhat easy pace. It wasnt bad when runs were 20-30mins at the beginning, but after increasing distance to cover 45min-60min each run then it wasnt optimal at all. I also did ""recovery"" runs with 50-50 walk-run at ""very easy"" pace, that were surely in zone 2 even closer to zone3. During those first 3 months my calves were sore/stiff like everyday and after running 5 minutes my calves would feel super heavy and whole run would feel like shit because of that.

Now Im going with heart rates and running in lthr zone 2 is a lot slower than I have previously ran and it even requires a lot of walking to keep my heart rate in that zone, and its fine. I trust the process. Its so easy to run/walk at that pace and Im looking forward to going to a next run instead of having to force myself. Just listen to a podcast and run on a super easy pace!

It took a few months to heal, but eventually I was able to walk, dance, lift/carry, \_etc.\_ like the injury had never even happened. However, out of an irrational fear that I'd tear it again, I've been avoiding running in the two years since the tear. In the last month or two, I've started to get over that fear. However, I noticed a new and very concerning issue:

I can't run or even jog more than about 20 yards before that previously torn muscle cramps up. No amount of stretching seems to make a difference. My wife also noticed that the muscle is visibly much smaller than the other leg. I went to an orthopedist to have it checked out, but nothing showed up in an X-ray, and the specialist is honestly surprised I'm having trouble running on it.

running,"Good day,

I've just begun a Garmin 10k training plan. In the past, I've either programmed my own training, mixing strength work (kettlebells, bodyweight, HIIT, Etc) with casual running (easy runs, trail running, occasionally intervals) OR I've done some sort of strength focused program (Garage Gym Athlete, Dry Fighting Weight, 10,000 swing challenge) and added running mostly for fun. So this is my first time choosing a running program, and I'm excited about it. I'm running a Savage Race in late September (which I'm already""fit enough"" to take on), but as it's around 10k, thought it'd be fun to push the run training to the next level.

I'm curious if anyone has experience mixing kettlebell work (or any non running strength type work) with focused run training. My general thinking is to use lighter kettlebells and not do quite as much volume as I might typically during a strength program.

If you do have experience, did you:

A. Do the strength work the same day as the runs?
          1. Same workout, before the run
          2. Same workout, after the run

running,"Ok, I have been trying to add more cardio into my gym routine and over the last couple weeks I’ve been ending my workouts with a 1-1.5 mile run. I’ve also noticed that, again over about the last two weeks, my knees and especially my right knee have been achy and sore all the way to the right hurting bad enough on multiple days that I’m taking ibuprofen every 6 hours or so.

I am a 6’ 4” veteran who works a manual labor job so I know my joints aren’t the best already but my friend made the connection that the pain didn’t really start like this until I started running again. Which brings me to my shoes. I’ll be honest, The shoes I’m currently using are $12 Walmart “athletic” shoes that I bought in a pinch while my household goods were being moved back home while I was getting out of the military so I know they are no where near quality and that can’t be good for my joints. But…. But… I’m not super knowledgeable about running shoes so before I assume that this is the issue and I go out and drop a decent chunk of change on some decent shoes and possibly find out that wasn’t the issue I wanted to gauge other runners and see what you all think.

Is it super likely that my shoes are the issue and I need to go get some quality ones asap or is it likely a different issue? Thanks in advance for tolerating my stupid question guys!",Are my shoes causing my knee pain?

Foot pain. Calluses. Back pain. Knee pain. Now hip pain is the newest culprit and I'm again, not sure if it's running or something more minuscule causing it. I noticed months ago that I couldn't lay on my left side due to mild pain and uncomfortable in my left hip and lower back area. It isn't unbearable, I can sleep on that side if I must, but it can be pretty unpleasant. It hasn't gone away, but it hasn't gotten worse or better.

Weird thing is, I only have the pain when I lie directly on it. I'm fine when I'm running, walking, sitting down, laying down on my back, but when I lie down on the hip? Pain. I'm not sure what it could be, every time I google something I get at least 10 different results telling me what it could be.

running,"My local sports centre (Brio in the UK) now charges £4.40 to use their track. At this price, it would total £36 a month to run there twice a week (although a gym membership gets access at £28). I would happily pay £2 a go, because often I'm only on it doing sprints for 30 - 45 minutes.

The government is constantly talking about health problems and a lack of facilities, yet a lot of these tracks aren't used simply because they are so expensive.

running,"Hi all,

I was hoping to ask for some general guidance. I'm 26, I spent most of my earlier years 16-23 totally inactive, smoking a lot, eating lots of unhealthy food.

In recent years I've tried to get fitter, but I've always struggled with consistency. I am asthmatic and I take a puff before I go running, but one of my biggest anxiety inducers relates to a slight light-headedness.

I've always suffered from head rushes when I stand up, but let's say I start running for 30 seconds without warming up... when I then stop running, i will feel a bit lightheaded and 'spinny' for about 30 seconds. I have no idea why this happens, but it makes me anxious that I have something wrong with me. The doctors have done ECG's and not found anything wrong.

I have also started couch to 5k a few times, and I've occasionally gotten to the point where I can run for 30 minutes without stopping, but I do often feel short of breath while running, even if I'm running at a 12 minute mile for 5 minutes.

Should I expect these things to take time? Is it normal to not be able to run far after years of inactivity? How long should it take to change? Do these things sound normal?

running,"Hey guys!

* Let me start with some context: 

I am 23M and I can call my self overall fit person. I've been active/very active my whole life thanks to running, playing basketball, working out at the gym, hiking and so on. In May I got back to running after a significant break and I signed up for a trial half marathon which is going to take place on July 31st. 

I've never run a half marathon nor have I raced on trail, but I really like hiking and running, so I decided to combine both. My goal is just to finish the race and have fun. Given that I live in a city centre (4th biggest city in the country) it's hard for me to run on trail, so usually my short/medium runs are done in the city and then my long run is done on grassy/gravel paths alongside the river on the outskirts.

Fastest 5k: 25:24 (official race, I ran it at the end of my 2nd training week)

Fastest 10k: 56:40

My usual pace is 6:00-6:10min/km which I found comfortable and I can maintain it for 15km.

&amp;#x200B;

* Training:

Since there is not much time between May and July I decided that an 11 week training program has to be enough. [HERE](https://imgur.com/a/5YHrP9W) you can see the initial plan and below how it's going... 

I wanted to start with 5 runs/week what would include - 3 easy short/medium runs during the week, long run on Sunday and a veeery short run on Saturday just to warm up a bit. 

Reality hit and it turned out that it's hard to combine 5 runs with work, social life, spending time with wife and so on, so I cut it to 4 runs. Also, you can see that my schedule started to vary as I sometimes had to reschedule my long run.

My peak performance was definitely Week 5 when I ran 42km overall including a 15km long run which felt like nothing. 

Then, during the weekend after that 15k came a really harsh heat wave that doesn't want to go away. It's like 28-35\*C everyday in my area with 20-24\*C during night. It's making running and resting very hard and I suppose that's why the past week and this week have been terrible. If you look at Week 6 numbers, everything seems alright, but I really feel the fatigue right now. My resting HR is higher by 30 points constantly, with excessive sweating it's hard to be fully hydrated, so in general my poor recovery on days off translates then to shitty running experience. I managed to pushed through it during week 6 but yesterday I had a bit of a crisis.

I started this week (7) with a nice 9km run (the goal was 6,5kms at least) because it was surprisingly ""cold day"" - 23\*C, cloudy sky and it was raining till afternoon. However, the next day there were 32\*C and I just hit the wall after 1st KM of Wednesday run and came back home registering just slow 2k. I wanted to make up for it and hit \~10km but again - 33\*C with clear sky limited me to 6,5km which still was pretty hard. 

I plan to run 15k this Sunday but the forecast says it will be very hot day, 32\*C with no clouds so most likely I will hit the road after 8pm or something but I am still worried that I won't make this long run...  I won't do any running till that day and add a little hike in much better conditions on Sunday morning. 

After current week (7) I have only 4 weeks left which include a 5-day business trip as you can see in the picture. I will most likely be able to run only once this week so I think it will be a long run and then maaaybe I will squeeze in one run while on the trip. It also makes me doubt my final form for the race.

&amp;#x200B;

* Summary:

What can you tell about my strategy after having read my post and seen my training plan?  I will just add that I don't do any special run like intervals/tempo runs and so on. All my sessions are ""normal"" runs, usually at the pace of 6:00-6:10min/km. Sometimes when I feel well rested I try fartlek runs  to play with different speeds and so on. 

I know that I should be training more on actual trail routes but there aren't many in my area and as I said earlier, I am living in the city centre so I don't have much choice. I will definitely run one of my last long runs on trail just to know what to expect on race day.

&amp;#x200B;

How would you rate this plan? Would you recommend some changes?

running,"Hey runners, this is my first time to share my race day experience. I’ve participated in 4 marathons and they were all both painful and joyful. Each time I discovered something new about myself.
My training started 6 months before the race. I have to say that training in the cold was a huge challenge for me, because I often just wanted to hide in my warm house! As many people say, getting out of the house is always the hardest part. Anyway, I'm glad I persevered.

Training:
My best marathon time is 3:56:30, so I chose a sub-4 running plan. I used an app to generate a customized plan for me to use. I basically did as it told me, but I also adjusted it a bit to my own conditions. For example, I'm good at controlling my pace, but I always have problems with a lack of endurance around the 20-mile mark. So I focused more on strength training, long runs, and interval runs this time.
I run 4 days a week, cross-train 1 day (strength or other cardio), take 1 day of active rest (I'll walk 10km or do some stretching), and take a full rest day (I love it!). Running workouts include easy runs, long runs, interval runs, paced runs, and LSD, which is adjusted by period and my physical condition. Here is an example:
・5 x 900m intervals + 5 x 200m 
・900m interval x5 
・30km run 
・2 hours LSD 
・200m interval x15 + 400m x5 + 1000m 
・15km pace run 
The hardest part of the training process is the temperature. Very cold or very hot weather can be a real challenge for outdoor running training! I've even tried to train outside on cold, rainy days to be fully prepared for the worst race conditions (not for this race, but for other winter marathons). Does anyone else prepare for the worst for a race like this? :)

Gear:
Brooks hyperion tempo, Nike Race Day Fast shorts, radom tank tops, Pro Compression socks (personally I prefer full-length type), Asics MESH cap.
 
Nutrition:
I tried to keep everything simple. Breakfast was bagels and bananas. Pre-race: 1 pack of Katsuo Stamina (good for endurance and recovery). During race: Science in Sport energy packs (thinnest and most drinkable ones I think!), Katsuo Stamina, water. Immediately after the race: banana and low-fat chocolate milk.
 
The Race:
Great marathon weather! It was sunny but not too hot. Waiting for the race to start is always the most nerve-wracking, but this time I felt quite relaxed. Because of the pandemic, this was my first race of this magnitude. The good vibes around me were contagious!
 
Everything went smoothly at the beginning of the race. I controlled my pace according to my plan. The first half of the race I tried to keep pace at 8:40 min/mile. My legs felt good, and I didn't have any stomach trouble. I took some SIS gels every 4 miles, and then hydrated properly. The first half seemed to be perfect!
 
But…as many people say, no marathon is perfect. My problems started to show up in the second half of the race. Usually I get leg fatigue and leg cramps around mile 20, but this time I took another Katsuo at mile 13, so my legs didn't have any real problems. My problem was the temperature. Yes, temperature. Like I said, it wasn't too hot at the time of the race. But after I started running for a while, I still inevitably started sweating. I think this time I didn't use the water at the aid station as often as I should have to keep myself cool.  This was probably the main reason for my second half loss. I started to experience some heat stroke-like symptoms, dizziness and some nausea. By the end of the race I couldn't eat any more energy gels and my pace dropped to 9-9:31 min/mile.
 
But thankfully I persevered. I honestly don't fully recommend this approach – it’s not safe. The most important thing is to listen to your body. I sort of did the opposite, probably because my pride pushed me to run to the finish line.

running,"This is something I was thinking about while taking my after run shower.

So when running a 5K you pretty much run at your threshold for the duration of the race, right?

If you started running this may translate to running at your threshold for 30 minutes, but after some training this could be reduced to running at your threshold for 20-25 minutes.

running,"I'm in my late 20s and I've definitely slowed down from my early 20s. 

My mileage at 21 was maybe 10 miles a week, but clocking in 8-8:30 a mile and pushing very hard. I was also 10kg lighter than I am currently, but with very little muscle. I was doing 6:48 miles for a 5k. I was doing regular track speedwork and hill sprints.

A few intervening injuries with my ankles, hips and knees had forced me to reconsider how I was running and getting stronger overall. 

Several years later, I'm doing 25 miles a week with hills being incorporated into long runs. No other speedwork. My pace for a hilly long run has settled at a more comfortable 9:30-9:50 a mile and I'm not getting quite as hurt. I've stopped doing parkruns, which I was effectively treating as a race every week. I'm also much heavier than would be ideal for running but stronger (I'm 75kg/174cm). In the intervening time period, I had taken on weightlifting. 

At my current weight, I don't think I can do the same 6:48 flat out mile I did before, nor do I have the same top end speed I used to, but I can attack the hills in a way that would've got me hurt years ago.

So the question is - have you gotten quicker over the years, slower, better or worse at hills?","How, if at all, has your running pace changed over the years?"
running,"Hi folks!

So a little bit of background, I grew up wearing only socks around the house (and clothes sometimes :P) and currently while I'm inside I also just wear socks.

I started running recently and signed up for a half marathon, got a pair of Nike Pegasus 38 (140km on them so far) and started training, on one of my longest runs (15k) my knees felt like they were locking up and I felt some pain going up and down the stairs that day, then after any longish run (above 5k) I started having some knee discomfort, which I've associated with IT band syndrome (everything sort of checks out). So I've started some routines that have helped me alleviate the pain + reduced my running volume.

I came accross barefoot running as an alternative and a lot of folks claim to be running injury free for a long time, so I ordered some Altra Escalantes (zero drop). But I'd like to give barefoot/minimalist shoes a try too.

Yesterday I ran around 5 minutes barefoot in my backyard and felt OK, no issues or soreness, so Today I grabbed my aqua shoes and went for a short run (4k) and feel OK so far, IT band still a bit present but it went away after some rehab exercises.

&amp;#x200B;

So with that in mind I've been going down the rabbit hole and I'm thinking about:

\- Vibram KSOs - 100/90 USD- a bit expensive/weird looking but a lot of people really like them, so I'm wondering how durable are they?

\- Primus lite iii -150 USD- Very expensive but they seem to be quite durable (1000miles +?)

\- Merrel Vapor glove - 90 USD- not sure how durable these are and they don't seem to be that minimalist

\- Xero shoes - 90 USD - some complaints about build quality

TLDR: What are the most cost effective barefoot/minimalist shoes for running.

I have been running for 15 years casually. 3 times a week. I don't go fast, just jogging in order to keep fit and I usually run for 30 minutes each time on a treadmill. I'm 36 years old.

Around 4 months ago I begin having something strange happen. When I get to around 8-10 minutes into the run, even though the pace is the same, my heart rate will suddenly begin increasing in speed, faster and faster until I have to stop running through feeling like my heart is beating so fast it will explode if I continue. When this happens it takes around 20-30 minutes to feel normal again.

The first time it happened I put it down to drinking too much coffee that morning as the next run it didn't happen. Then on the 5-6th run it happened again and once again I had to stop and I hadn't had any coffee that day.

Since then I now get this around every 3 weeks (1 in 5/6 runs) and have to stop the run.

I went to the doctor and they ran a test on a running machine with me attached to it via wires to check the heart. When I did this test the fast heart rate issue didn't happen and the result came back fine. The doctor seemed to think it was nothing to be concerned by.

running,"Earlier this month, I observed that whenever I consumed more protein, my shins would hurt significantly less during the next day's run. I guess it's because the protein helped my leg muscles recover significantly. 

With that in mind, I upped my daily protein intake to 90-100 gms. I weigh 67 kgs, so that's around 1.3-1.5 times. I consume 3-4 different proteins (soy isolate, pea protein isolate, whey protein, mung bean protein) daily. 

The result? I've been able to crank out 153 kms in the last 13 days. It'd have been simply impossible before as my shins would have killed me.

Yes, I do take care of my calcium intake and also do toe raises, calf raises and glute exercise, but increasing my protein intake has helped it all come together.

Also, another pleasant benefit is that since my shins no longer hurt, I can actually run in relatively thin cushioned shoes (18 mm heel, 10 mm forefoot) and still enjoy pain-free running.

running,"I’m a 33f who was a super regular runner about 5 years ago, but then life happened… I’m 40 pounds heavier and the most I had “run” in over a year was about 1.5 miles.  

I’ve been back at it for about 6 weeks now, and it feels great. That said, I’m noticing some changes in how I’m adapting to pacing and distance that have me a little frustrated. 

First, the comfortable pace that I settle in to is about 10:05-10:30 which is totally fine. The problem with that is I can’t do more than a quarter mile at that speed. I know that the “duh” answer is to slow down, but running at 12:30 or so just isn’t comfortable. It feels harder, and I just can’t get in my zone. I remember a little of this when I got into running the first time, but I feel like it passed sooner. 

Second- I have been finding that the most effective way for me to build endurance is doing run:walk and gradually shifting the intervals until I’m eventually running for whatever distance I want. This time around, I’m having trouble finding my run:walk sweet spot that will enable me to progress at a reasonable rate without hurting myself.

running,"Hi all,

I try to get as much info as possible via searching forums and what not before I ask questions, but I figure it still doesn't hurt to ask. 

I'm in fairly decent shape from being active military, but never a big runner other than my yearly 1.5mile run for my PT test. That being said, the times I do run, I've never noticed any pain before. I've recently gotten into running and I'm looking to start training to tackle a marathon this November. Ive been running 5 or 6km just about every day for the last couple weeks, but on Sunday I felt pretty good and just kept going to about 13km. For some reason near the end, my left knee started to ache every time I picked my foot up and bent my knee to take another step. The next day was rough. Moving my leg in any position other than straight was painful. Im sure I looked pretty stupid trying to hobble up and down the stairs at my office. Today is Wednesday and the pain is pretty much gone, but Im nervous about running anymore until I figure out the issue. This same thing happened several weeks ago, but I blamed it on just being stiff from not running on a regular basis.


My question is, where do you go first to figure out the cause and solution to issues like this? Should I be looking at my shoes (I have a pair of Saucony Kinvara 12 shoes that I bought a couple weeks ago)? Should I look at knee braces/wraps? Should I focus on doing more strength training in my quads? Is it a mix of everything? Supplements/fish oil?

running,"So I had a half marathon planned for late 2020, obviously that was canceled. I donated my entry fee, canceled my gym membership, and worked from home into 2021…into 2022.

Doing lots of cross training, trying to strengthen my glutes and hammies in particular. I’m at 7 miles for my long runs and looking at a half in October, but my quads lately have been absolutely wrecked. I cut this morning’s run short from pain and am considering taking 1-2 weeks off to listen to my body and hope I didn’t push it too far (I’ll probably just focus on form and core workouts). Will this ruin my progress? Do I need to start off at a lower mileage afterwards, or will I be able to pick back up and go for 8? Just so bummed since I’m trying so hard to get back to the old me.

I want to play this pain off because I just started this exciting journey and I don’t want to miss out on all the runs I already signed up and paid for, but it’s also probably smarter to get it checked out and hope I can get it healed fast, rather than ignoring it and letting it fester.

running,"I know versions of this question have been asked, but I'm looking more for marathon training and stomach flu-specific answers because it relates a lot to appropriate fueling. 

I have a marathon in 3 months, my first for which I am very excited \*and very nervous). Obivously, the training plan is very rigorous and intensive at 5-6 runs a week. Missing one run happens, but now I am looking at almost a week and am worried about how it will impact my progress or my training plan.

I had a stomach flu or food poisoning off and on for roughly 5 days, during which I did not run. I also did not really eat and as a result, I am feeling weaker.  I am feeling better now (i.e. I have gone for a short walk, I can work, I'm hydrated, etc.) but am still not able to eat much to meet my daily nutritional needs, let alone compensate for having not eaten for so long. I am hopeful that I will be able to start eating fully normally in a few days but I am still feeling a bit sensitive after having been ill for so long.

My question is: When would you recommend getting back into training (as soon as possible vs wait til you're eating normally, etc)? How would you adapt the training program? Has this ever happened to you? I would love to get advice or hear your experiences.

I stopped running because the dog might trip me up and then the dog jumped up on me - playfully, but it did result in a scratch on my leg. Not that bothered about that but I did want to get on with my run so I asked her to control her dogs please. Perhaps I should have chosen better words.

At this point I let her walk on until she was at a point I could pass her with a wide berth although I did note that when the next running passed her she held the dogs.

Is this an issue? I do make sure I hit my daily nutrient goals and I eat appropriately 120-150 grams of protein a day.",I don't hit my BMR due to running/exercise. Is this an issue?
running,"I have picked up running again in march but because I was wary of injuries by running too long a distance too early I told myself to just stick to 5k's every time.
I have been doing that and trying to do them as fast as possible and I recently hit 24:48 as a PR.

I am now wondering however if it would not be more productive to just do 10k runs?",Improving 5k times through time trials or through longer runs?

running,"Hi all -

I've been running for years and have done every distance up to a half marathon, looking to run my first marathon in October. I've been steadily training on my own, but will be following this regiment from now (based on the Novice 1 Hal Higdon format: https://imgur.com/7CrOxMU) 

Are the long runs I have indicated long enough or should I strive for longer runs? Additionally, what are your suggestions for taking in nutrition during the race? I've never drank/ate during a race before and have been drinking and eating before longer runs recently to help ""train"" my gut to hold more water and food. Any advice is helpful, thank you!",Marathon Novice Training - Seeking advice on eating/drinking during race and mileage for training
running,"So in mid 2020, I completely snapped my Achilles’ tendon. A forgotten ultrasound scan (which I had to mention) led to surgery the next day to stitch it back together. 

Two weeks boot &gt; two weeks cast &gt; three months boot and then a physical recovery which took about a year to feel right when walking. 

I still can’t wear hiking boots when walking the dogs as it’s too irritable. Still get stiffness and pains every now and then. 

I was back playing football, although not in full 90 minute capacity almost around this time last year. Never truly felt comfortable or normal. 

But I recently started running to try and truly strengthen the muscles in my left leg. 

Today I recorded my fastest 5k time yet and am very pleased with how far I’ve come and am hoping to continue.",Obliterated my Achilles Tendon in 2020 and have finally found a pair of trainers that make running comfortable. Just recorded my fastest 5k yet in 26:53.
running,"Hello all!

I’m 25F and have been pretty active my whole life. I’ve been trying to run with a “half marathon” goal for like 4-5 years straight now. I pretty much always give up because the burning I feel in the arches of my feet when I run. 

The burning sensation is pretty much immediate when I start running (within the first half mile) and it sucks since I really don’t enjoy other forms of exercise. I’ve tried so many different shoes, gotten the feet scan at new balance, done the scans/treadmills etc at fleet feet as well, with tailored shoe inserts. I’ve tried new balance, hoka, Nike, Brooks, and many more. 

What is strange is that I don’t feel this pain any other team, even when walking in the same shoes, it is strictly running. This is super sad and discouraging, does anyone have any advice? 

Every time I try a new pair of shoes I try to give them at least a few months to break in. was considering trying those hokas that are really thick but I can’t keep dropping money on shoes. Thanks everyone",Arch pain
running,"I just ran my first marathon, I barely made the cut off time. As miserable as the race experience was, I loved training, especially the long runs. How long should I wait to get back out there? How long can/should my longer runs be? I’ll definitely follow a training guide next time instead of simply focusing on distance but I also don’t want to lose the progress I’ve made in terms of distance. Also- aside from running the race faster, what goals did you set for yourself after your first marathon?",What to do after marathon?
