firstmarathon,"hey there! training for my first marathon (Richmond in November) following the BAA level 2 plan. I have never really lifted weights/gone to the gym and have no idea what I’m doing. I know strength work is important for injury prevention, so what are some good exercises that I can incorporate?

firstmarathon,"At this point I have done almost everything that I can to get ready for the SF Marathon this weekend, but looking for any bits of reassurance from fellow marathoners and previous first timers. Below is a bit of my running history:

&amp;#x200B;

* I completed 95% of the Runner's World 16 week sub-4:00 marathon training program.
* Total volume through 15 weeks = 464 miles (31 MPW)
* Total volume through 52 weeks = 1054 miles (20 MPW)
* Completed long runs of 15, 17, 19, 21, 20 and 18 miles each.
* Most of my easy miles were at a pace of 9m30s @ 145 BPM
* I live in SF and am very familiar with the course. So much so that I have run 90% of it in both directions throughout my training. The only segments I haven't done are on the north side of GGB.
* All of my runs over 10 miles were completed w/ a hydration vest (2x 16 oz water w/ one serving of Skratch electrolyte powder in each (160 calories total).
* I plan to run with my vest as well - I like having the water on me and I'm used to it.
* I typically eat 1 serving of Clif Bloks every 45 minutes, or 1 Gu Gel.
* My first goal was to make it through the training without injury, my second goal is to finish the marathon, and my third goal is to finish in under four hours. (MP = 9m9s) My tentative pacing plan is:
   * Miles 1-3: 15-20 seconds slower than MP
   * Miles 4-7: 5-10 seconds slower than MP
   * Miles 8-13: 0-10 seconds slower than MP
   * Miles 14-20: MP, or 5-7 seconds faster than MP if feeling good
   * Miles 21-26: MP or 5-10 seconds faster than MP if feeling good",Looking for some Internet Karma + Confidence: First Marathon (SF Marathon in 6 days)
firstmarathon,"Hey ya’ll

So about 14 weeks out from this one. Hoping to complete it with no real time goal (but 4.5 would be nice)

Here’s my plan, feel free to critique it and and pointers.

No nutrition included (what could I add here?)

Current 1 mile pace averages around 10:30/mile on a 10 mile run.

July Week 1: 22 miles
July Week 2: 24
Aug Week 3: 26
Aug Week 4: 28
Aug Week 5: 30
Break week (no running)
Aug Week 7: 33
Sept Week 8: 36
Sept Week 9: 39
Break week (no running)
Sept Week 11: 42
Break week (no running)
Oct Week 13: 15
Oct Week 14: marathon 

So any given week was planning on doing a longest run of 10 miles, but hit the weekly mileage by doing multiples of 10 miles throughout the week, with smaller runs to fill in the gaps.

Currently not doing any strength training mostly for time considerations. (40+ miles per week is going to eat up at least 4/7 days)

But let me know if there are gaps in my thinking and I should do longer 1-time runs/cross train or have nutrition plan.

Again my goal would be 4:30, but I would happy to finish under 5.

I'm a male, 6'1 195lb so I've definitely got weight to drop but it's not like I'm severely overweight. My long run this week was 12 miles and it has happened on other runs up to this point. I bought Body glide and used it today, but it apparently didn't do its job. 

One theory is it was muggy/humid and sunny, albeit only mid 70's. I sweat a LOT, so maybe today was particularly ""wet"" to overcome the prep work, especially considering I experienced my first manhood chafing... that was fun to find jumping in the shower.

firstmarathon,"I'm doing my first ever marathon in London this October. So far I've been following the beginner's training plan here  [Training plans - TCS London Marathon](https://www.tcslondonmarathon.com/training/training-plans)   


I was regularly doing more than they suggested for the first two weeks so I went straight in on week three and am about five weeks ahead (working through week 9 at the mo) which I though would give me time to take rest/injury weeks or just for general life stuff to get in the way if it happens. If I have no injuries or need for breaks I thought I'd maybe just repeat a few weeks before doing the 20 miler at the optimum time.  


But looking through other training plans that have been shared this seems to be asking a lot less of me than those suggesting you do four or five days of training a week. Should I be starting to think about adding in extra sessions? I'm occasionally subbing the easiest run of the week in for a swim session. Usually around a mile. Should I do the swim as an additional rather than substitute? So far I've been keeping up with this plan just fine, but I wonder if it's suddenly going to prove too much for me if I don't put more groundwork in now.",Are the training plans provided on the London Marathon website coming up short?
firstmarathon,"I'll start with some context on my running. 

I've been running for several years now. Usually 4-5 days a week. 10 KM's at a time. I love to wake up and run a 10K before work. My time is around 53:00, give or take a minute, depending on how I feel. I'm not super concerned about time, more so just getting my ass out the door.

I've been training for my first marathon on October 16th. Trying to follow a training plan. Running less days, 3x8-10 K, and then long runs of around 20K on saturdays.

Last week, I had planned to take off due to vacation. I do not like running on vacation and I was busy with family and weddings. That's fine.

But now I've come home with Covid, and I'm about 3 1/2 months away from the marathon.

I'm not where I want to be training wise, and now that I just got Covid, I don't know how long I'll be not able to run.

Intermediate 1 does not include speed work.  Prior to starting, I was including some speed work at least once/week.  Would it hurt to add a short speed workout if I felt up to it?

My goal for the marathon is to finish but I’d like to finish &lt;4h which means 9min pace.  When training requires running at marathon race pace, should I run at 9min pace or should I go faster which I’m capable of?  Would that help reach my goal?",Questions re: my training program…

firstmarathon,"Long time runner, first time (hopefully) marathoner. I'm doing the Hal Higdon Novice 2 program to prepare for the New York Marathon this fall. My goal is just to finish, ideally with a smile on my face and not regretting my entire life. I've done a few halfs (halves?) in the past and always took the training pretty easy, moving things around however I needed but just making sure to get the long runs in. 

Is that approach okay for the full marathon training? Or how important is it to run /rest on the exact days listed in the plan? For example, if I'm going to be busy on the weekend could I squeeze all of my runs into the week? Or is getting that rest day in before the long run crucial?  I know the risk of injury with a full is a lot higher than with a half so I want to make sure I'm setting myself up for success, but I also want to keep my life as ""normal"" as possible while training.",How flexible are these training plans?
firstmarathon,"About myself first.

I'm 48, hover around 200-205lbs @ 5'9"". I have a decent amount of body fat, but muscle as well. 

I power-lifted for a few years up until just before COVID. Stopped due to COVID. Tried to resume and lower back pain and shoulder issues (the discomfort) returned so I stopped. Did one competition about five years ago. I can walk up cold and still squat 350lbs and deadlift 400lbs. I've always had a strong lower body. 

I do BJJ 2-3 time per week. Competed once about four years ago.

I've always had terrible cardio and hated it in general. When I was doing Crossfit years ago, I always lagged during the cardio days, but really enjoyed the lifting days. 

I started running because I wasn't lifting heavy any longer and need to do something to keep fit. I don't want to be in my 50's, 60's, 70's, hunched over, supper fat and slobby, dealing with multiple health issue because I didn't pay attention to myself. Surprising myself, I decided on running. I think the attraction is I can do it anywhere anytime. I was visiting my mom in Montreal and it was fun just going out and running a random 5 km route. Did this same thing the next day in rural Quebec at the in-laws. Listed to the birds, smelled the manure, didn't listen to music at all that run. 

I like to challenge, push myself. I know I'll never be elite in the activities I do, but I want to push myself and ""win"". A win to me means participating and going as far as I can. For example, the BJJ competition was a silver medal for me. I didn't expect to place, so it was a win. If I were to enter a marathon, a win would be finishing. That would be a win for me. 

I started running on June 19th, and did 2.6-2.7 kms 7 days in a row. First run was low 18 minutes. Last run was mid 15 minutes.

Next a did seven days in a row of 5-5.1 kms (I never run the same route). Times were between 31.5-36 minutes.

I think my running is pretty good for a guy that didn't like running. I'm not a couch to 5 km guy as I've been active physically for many years, just not active running.

http://www.strathearnharriers.org.uk/our-races/strathearn-marathon

First 10km we're pretty good. Up hill mostly but in the pack definitely gave me a boost and made good time. 

10km - 20km. A long level stretch then downhill. People kept passing me slowly but I stuck to my pace. Picked up a gel from my wife at 18km which helped as there was a huge hill at 19km. Slow going up to the 20km mark and legs started to get tired. 

20km - 30km. Undulating road in and out of the shade. It got pretty hot but a breeze kept me cool. The downhills took more out of my legs than the ups. Was still on pace and got to 30km in 2h 50m which I was super pleased with. Smashed another gel at 30km then it all fell apart. 

30km - 42km. The route then turned into the wind and along a hilly stretch. The alight hill just killed my speed and legs and the wind made it really hard. Slowed right down to about 7:30min/km sometimes less. I walked a few bits as my muscles started to really hurt but walking was harder than my shuffling run. Various pains got worse and my emotions and mood went right down. I wasn't going to quit but I really wanted to. Pushed on and had crazy swings in energy. Up and down pace, and mood.

Last 2km I forced a run again and pushed along the home straight. Finished at 4h 26m and collapsed onto the grass and lay there for a long time. 

Looking back today I had a good time but straight after I felt awful. Sick and tired, fun body pine and needles. Legs feel ok today but my knees and feet are sore. 

The route was really nice. Beautiful rolling quiet country roads, amazing views. Marshals and people along the route were great. It's a pretty small rum club marathon so quite low key. If you're in Scotland though I'd recommend it, you're not gonna get a PB but it's a beautiful place to run.

I've gone for two short runs and the pain was there, but again not terrible. Just in my right knee. Icing and motrin have helped but is the fact that I'm still feeling pain a week later a concern?

firstmarathon,"I just finished my first full marathon last weekend.  So stoked to have it done.  It ended up being a gut wrenching run but was so rewarding to finish it and have that marathon medal.  I followed the Marathon handbook 4 hour marathon training plan and honestly came to hate running some days.  I didn't mind the long runs on the weekends but the 8 or 9 mile midweek runs were tough while trying to work and parent.  Speed work felt like a chore and I likely skipped too many cross training days because I was simply too tired.  Finish time was 3:58.  My race goal was 3:50 but like most first timers I did not set a realistic goal.

I felt absolutely great until mile 22 and then the last 4.2 miles were a real struggle.  I couldn't stay cool and couldn't make it the full distance between aid stations without walking.  Once I crossed the finish line I could barely stand up and any sort of food or drink made me want to throw up.  I kept walking around the finishing chute and forced myself to drink some chocolate milk and a couple of orange slices and started to feel better.  When I got home I realized my lawn needed to be mowed and walking along behind the mower was probably the best thing I could have done to stay loose.

I’m planning to run my first marathon in Berlin (25.09.2022) and I’ve already looked into a lot of the popular training plans but I was wondering if it is possible to just train for it without a concrete plan. I had Covid in April so I’m not as fit as I’ve used to be right now so I don’t aim for a specific time anyway. I also work in night shifts on changing week days so I won’t be able to get my runs done at the exact week day every week.

firstmarathon,"Hey folks, have loved this sub as I spent the last 5+ months training for my first marathon.

Until 2.5 years ago I wasn't a runner, but got it in my head that I wanted to run a marathon. Unfortunately the first one I signed up for got cancelled due to Covid (3 months into training...), but I bided my time and signed up again \~2 years later in December of 2021 for the Ottawa Marathon.

The training was a grind:

* after a month, Toronto (where I live) went back into lockdown and I was forced to start running outside in January (not so fun in Canada...)
* I caught Covid in early April - less than 2 months from race day - which knocked me out for a week and gave me a bit of a scare
* I learned a lot in terms of fuelling, hydrating and recovering properly (especially for runs &gt;20km)

The race was even more of a grind, but just what I was looking for and then some:

* it was my first ""real"" race, and running with that many runners and with so many people cheering was incredible
* my longest training run was 30km, and going beyond that was one of the hardest things I've ever done. It was also one of the coolest experiences of my life, one I'll never forget
* beyond the 35km mark was all mental. I was tired, dehydrated (it got real sunny/hot after a few hours), blistered on both feet and felt like a zombie - but kept pushing. You learn a lot about yourself and what you can do if you block out what your body is telling you and don't give up

When I finally finished, it was just pure happiness. I originally signed up because I wanted a big, new challenge and this lived up to it. I spent hours reading threads on here about people finishing and wasn't sure how I'd feel when I did, and it's hard to explain.

I was so happy to finish that I choked up and balled my eyes out when I found/hugged my parents and girlfriend that were there to cheer me on and celebrate with at the finish line.

It's exactly what I wanted in a challenge, and while I might include some running in my exercise routine in the future (and maybe run a half with friends if convinced), am not sure I'll do it again. 

Thanks to everyone in this sub for all the great posts, comments and help!

firstmarathon,"Ran my first marathon this year... in Antarctica! Was working at McMurdo station and they host a half and full marathon. I was originally just going to do the half but didn't imagine another opportunity to do a full marathon on the continent. It was 14 degrees, no wind (unheard of down there!) and sunny on the permanent ice shelf, which feels really warm when you are used to living in 0 and sub-zero temps. It took me 6 hours, I did not stop running and my pace was around 14-15min/mile I believe.

Before the marathon I had only been running and training 2-3 miles per run, maybe twice a week. I definitely felt this lack of training during the marathon though, never felt more physical/muscular pain in my life! 

HOWEVER, it also unlocked a mentality that I can do whatever I put my mind to. Extremely rewarding and moving; I cried at the finish!!

I signed up for a half marathon at the end of October and a full in mid-January.

My pace averages around 8:30, all distances considered. I’m more concerned about my HR. I just got a HR monitor, and spent most of my 10mi run in the 150s-160s, which is not ideal from what I’ve read about Zone 2 training, etc. I had a hard time making myself run slower, but was able to bring my HR down a bit by focusing on my breathing.

I’m going to be more disciplined about running slower to keep my HR down, but would love any other tips for training that will help improve my HR/aerobic fitness. Shorter and slower runs? Usual distance runs but slower?

I am planning to run the Chicago marathon this October, and am set to start my official training cycle on June 6th.

This week, so far, I managed a rough 4 miler as I am just getting over COVID, the week before that was about 8 total miles right before getting COVID, the week before about 12 total miles, etc. 

For context, this will be my 2nd marathon - did Philly last November following Hal Higden's Novice I. Then, trained pretty hard for a faster half marathon time using Hal's Intermediate 2 plan January-March (half was at the end of March), where I topped out around 30mpw. 

My plan was to follow Hal's Intermediate I for Chicago, but the starting weekly milage is 24mpw. I wanted a higher mileage plan to try to get a faster time, but I don't know that I've done enough training to train at that mileage. Going from 8-12mpw to 24mpw seems like a big jump.

I'm an on and off runner and recently decided to take it up again. I signed up for the NYC marathon and got in (!!!!), but now I'm experiencing insertional achilles tendonitis and stopped running. 

My goal is to recover in May but start training in June-Nov which gives me 5 months. I've been doing yoga, strength training, and the pain is somewhat mild. I""m just nervous that once I start the full program, the pain will creep back in. At this point, I'm open to walking/running it.

firstmarathon,Hello running Redditors.  Have ran two half marathons this year in preparation for Grandma's in June.  I have been diagnosed with Posterior Tibial Tendonitis after my last half in March and am doing physical therapy and seeing a podiatrist.  In the meantime I've got a little over 7 weeks to train and have been doing a Peloton endurance regimen on the bike about 3-5 times a week and strength training.  Anyone have experience doing bike replacement training for long periods of time?  I'm waiting to get the ok to start running again.  Other suggestions to supplement training in the meantime?

firstmarathon,"I just signed up for the Marine Corps Marathon, an item that has been on my bucket list for decades (I'm a former Marine), even when I thought I'd never become a runner (and I don't know that I'd go so far as to call me that now).  

The event is 30 Oct, so I have 6 months to prepare/train, which sounds like a lot of time but there are several family/life events in there that will knock out training availability for weeks at a time.  However, that's not the basis for my question, so I digress...

Currently, I run 3 days a week: Tuesday is my short run (currently 6.5mi), Thursday is my mid run (currently 9.5mi) and Saturday is my long run (currently 12mi); I try to increase mileage by 1.5mi to limit the interference it has on my lifting (I lift 2 days a week, which I'd like to continue doing).  Sunday I rest and Wednesdays I rest due to obligations. 

Is this schedule enough to get me marathon ready by October?  At that rate (if I'm consistent, outside those trips) I should be running \~50MPW with my long run just over 20.

Or should I follow a dedicated, proven marathon training plan (which would probably want me running 4 days)?",Marathon training - Is 3 days enough?

firstmarathon,"Got a marathon on Sunday. Got a covid and fever about 2 weeks ago. Fever and general illness stopped in a few days (triple waxed), but I just cannot get rid of this cough. Training in the past few weeks have been fine as long as I stay below zone 4 (85% HR), which I obviously intend to do in the marathon anyways. Current coughing is because of a slimy throat and not sore lungs or anything.

I really want to travel and give it a go, but the coughing is so bad that I struggle with sleep and it doesn't seem to dwindle down at all. Usually I'm never sick for more than a few days at a time, but now I'm really struggling with getting healthy.

What should I do? Give it a go and be careful? Just stay at home and rest? Any tips for what I can do last minute? I've been looking forward to this for 6 months.

firstmarathon,"Well after all this training it’s almost upon me. My First Marathon is coming up next Sunday May 1st in Pittsburgh. Getting pretty nervous is not gonna lie and It doesn’t help that I suffered from some mild hip inflammation about two months ago that forced me to back down on my training significantly. Good news is my physical therapist checked me out yesterday and they say I look good and overall I feel pretty good. 

So I guess now all that’s left is just to taper and get ready for carbo loading. Going to be taking a rest day tomorrow though I will be doing one more strength training session at home with some of the exercises that I’ve been doing at PT. This weekend I’ll do a long run of around 8 to 9 miles followed by a shorter run of 4 miles on the other day. And for next week just some short 3 to 4 mile runs and a couple of striders thrown in there. 

I guess the only thing I should start figuring out now is how to carbo load. Since this is my first marathon I definitely want to make sure I do it right but I also am worried about overdoing it and having my race day be ruined by an upset stomach. Any advice on that would be immensely helpful.

But yea I think my strategy is just to kind of run and see how I feel. I have a goal range between 3:15 to 3:30 and while I’d definitely love to get in the higher range of that time I think I also need to start placing my expectations in the simple zone: just complete the race. I can always get that sub 3:15 in the next marathon and maybe even a sub 3 hour in another one.

firstmarathon,"I'm doing a half-Ironman in mid-October, which includes a half-marathon run, and I'd like to do a full marathon for my next challenge after that. The whole tri should take me roughly seven hours, so I figure if I can do that, then five hours of running should be totally do-able!

I have two local options for upcoming marathons: one in my city that's in December (2 months), or one that's about a 90 minute drive in early February (4 months). Both courses are completely downhill, so that's not really a factor.

I did my first half last month and finished in 2:45, nothing to sneeze at but I didn't die! I do run/walk intervals and have pretty good endurance, current ""long run"" pace is about 12:30/mi but I feel like I could definitely knock at least a minute off that by the winter.

I’ve been running for about a year and a half and my marathon training for the past 14 weeks has all been going to plan and I’ve been feeling great.

So fast forward a week of having the flu and a lot of fatigue, I’ve been for 2 suuuper slow recovery runs to try ease back into things and I am struggling big time!

## Background

44M, first marathon.

## Training

## The plan

In October 2021, having toyed with for a while with the idea of running a marathon, I took the plunge and signed up for Manchester.  I had run a couple of HMs and was generally fairly fit (running a few times a week, including one long run of around 15km), but I knew I needed a plan.  After reading around a bit, I decided to go with the ""Advanced 20 week plan"", from [Marathon Handbook](https://marathonhandbook.com/trainingplans/marathon-training-plans/).  I tweaked the schedule a bit to fit around other commitments, ending up with:

* Mon: easy run, gym session
* Tue: yoga, interval run
* Wed: easy run, gym session
* Thu: rest
* Fri: tempo run
* Sat: easy run
* Sun: long run

The weekly distance started at around 35km, building up to a peak of 65km, followed by the usual 3 week taper.  All sounds doable ...

## The reality

It started off fine, but after just a few weeks my left knee suddenly became very sore.  Not ideal, but at least there was plenty of time left - so I decided to stop running completely until it recovered.  By mid-December it was feeling better, so I gradually built up the volume, and was back on track by new year.

The next few months went perfectly - I was feeling strong, and on 6 March I ran the Cambridge Half Marathon.  Not wanting to push myself too hard, I ran with a friend and took it very easy, chatting most of the way around.

The following Tuesday, I went out for my interval run as per the plan ... and me knee went again.  Crap, this time it's really not ideal.  Time to see the physio, who diagnosed tendonitis (bright side: at least it's not a tear.)  Any chance I can still run the marathon?  Physio reckoned yes - RICE for a couple of weeks, then follow the last couple of weeks of taper.  The legs might not feel as loose as they should by race day, but I wouldn't lose much fitness.

Over the next few weeks, the knee was recovering - but very slowly.  Too slowly, meaning I did only a couple of very short runs before the event.  I packed and headed to Manchester feeling pretty uncertain about even starting the race.

## Pre-race

On the recommendation of a friend, my family and I stayed at the Innside hotel, which is just out of the city centre and a short tram ride from the start line.  We spent the Saturday sightseeing. I was still feeling anxious about the knee, but had decided to go for it.  After a rest in the afternoon, pizza for dinner, and preparing my race kit, I settled down for a not-entirely restful sleep.

Breakfast was granola, yoghurt, fruit and tea.  I put some fresh K-tape on my knee and headed out for the short walk to the station.  It was a cool morning, but hardly any wind and the forecast is for it to stay dry, if overcast.  The tram was packed with runners, chattering excitedly about the day ahead, and I finally started to get into the spirit.

From Old Trafford tram station, the journey to the start consists of three phases, starting with a big open area with plenty of space for warming up, and loads of toilets (good!).  I progressed through each stage as my bib colour was called, and before long it was time to discard my throw-away hoodie.  Just at this point, the sun came out - a good omen?  A couple of pacers (I couldn't read the flags, but I guessed 3:45) were a couple of hundred metres ahead, close to the start gantry, as we started moving ...

## Race

## Kilometers 1 - 8

Over the start line, there's no turning back now!  We're on a wide road, heading downhill towards the city centre.  I focus on sticking to 5:10/km pace, trying to get into a rhythm as soon as possible.

The route winds through some built-up areas, the crowds here fairly thin, but already cheering us on loudly.  Still focussing on settling my pace, I'm also making sure to keep my cadence up and my foot strike not to far forward - got to protect that knee!

Now we head into Deansgate, one of the main streets of the centre.  Many more spectators here, really giving me a huge lift.  The route takes us to the end of the road, past a large video screen (wave!) and then doubles back.

After leaving Deansgate, we pass the 8km mark.  Average pace is bang on 5:10, and I take my first SiS gel as planned.  From here on, I'm going to regularly fuel every 5km - alternating between gel, Clif Blocks and a Resilient Nutrition pouch (for caffeine and protein.)  I've used all of these on training runs, and had no problems - fingers crossed they sit as well today!

## Kilometers 9 - 21

After a section from which I don't remember a whole lot, we end up back at Old Trafford - running back past the start line on the other side of the road.  Still lots of people queuing up to start - in total (including relay teams) there are 26,000 runners here today!

Now we're heading out on the long road towards Sale.  Passing the 12km marker, I notice the distance on my watch is 200m out, so I press the lap button.  This is supposed to ""round"" the watch distance, so that subsequent alerts will then match the road markers ... except somehow what happens is that it causes the watch to announce ""13km"".  O ... kay, so I now have to remember to subtract 1km from the announcement at each alert!

Below an underpass, a DJ is blasting out techno.  The beats give me a huge boost, and I emerge from the gloom into the daylight with a huge smile on my face.  All of a sudden I realise I've caught those pacers, which are indeed 3:45.  Great: given that I started a few minutes behind them, I'm now running ahead of my ""A"" goal!

Running through Sale, my watch is beeping with text messages from my family.  I can't read the texts, but I know they have a link to my GPS position, so presumably are telling me I'm getting close and should look out for them.  I keep looking around, but don't see them, and before I know it we're out of Sale, heading towards Altrincham.  (It later turns out I ran right past them, shouting my name, and totally failed to spot them!)

The sun has gone, and clouds are building - maybe that dry forecast wasn't so reliable.  Never mind - as we run through leafy suburban streets, we pass 13km and then the half way marker :)

##  Kilometers 22 - 32

Coming into Altrincham, we go over a large bridge.  My legs aren't too happy about the incline - and worse, runners are going in the opposite direction on the other carriageway, so I know I have a repeat of this to look forward to.

That rise, however, pales into insignificance compared to the upward slog through the town itself.  It feels like it's never going to end, but the supporters are hollering louder than ever, and suddenly I arrive at the crest, take a sharp turn, and head back downhill.

Coasting now, I finally spot my family beside the road.  The kids are holding a home-painted ""GO DAD"" banner (made ""in secret"" the week before, though I suspected what they were doing!)  I slow down momentarily to say hello, and then am back on my way, with another huge smile on my face.

We head back over the bridge (not as bad as I feared), and out of Altrincham, back towards the city.  The sun comes out again, and I'm feeling good.  Maybe I can actually do this ...

## Kilometers 33 - 43

I still have plenty of energy, but my right calf is starting to tighten, and my pace fades slightly.  Gradually, I lose my grip on the 3:45 pacers.  I'm not too worried because I know I have that buffer ... although I don't know *exactly* how much ...

We head up Brooklands, another long, straight avenue.  I'd told myself before the race to look out for the road off here where my grandparents used to live ... but somehow the thought gets lost, pushed out by reminders to keep my head up, keep good form, keep smiling to trick the body into thinking everything is OK ...

Suddenly I notice people are starting to drop out left right and centre - some breaking into hobbling walks; others leaning on the walls of front gardens, looking utterly broken.  I remind myself how important it is to me to run every step of the way, even if I have to run a bit slower to make it.  I try to push away thoughts of my tight calf, and now also a tightening left hip ...

The kilometres continue to tick down (remember each time to subtract one from my watch's announcement!), and with every one I feel more confident that I can make it.  The 3:45 pacers are slowly pulling away, but still in sight - perhaps I can still squeak it?

Now I'm into mind game territory: just run as far as that street sign.  Now just run as far as that traffic light.  I've taken my last gel, but remember to have the occasional sip of water.  More people dropping out.  We pass 25 miles.  Huge cheers from the crowd.  Whenever someone calls my name (reading from the bib), I try to give a wave or thumbs-up.  And now I grit my teeth - nearly there ...

Through the ""half mile to go"" marker, but still can't see the finish.  Check my watch - time still looks good.  Round a bend, and finally there's the gantry.  Go for the best ""sprint finish"" I can manage (kind of a fast hobble) ... and finally ... over the line!

## Post-race

Utter, utter relief.  I take my medal and thank the marshal.  Someone asks me to pose for a photo; I smile my biggest grin.  The sun is out again now, and I feel simultaneously broken and amazing.

My watch said 3:45:06.  The text comes in almost immediately with the official time of 3:45:03.  So I just missed my ""A"" goal, but nevertheless I'm overjoyed with the result.

After staggering around a bit and doing some stretches, I grab a N/A beer from a stall and pretty much inhale the can in a single swig.  There are a load of mats with foam rollers, so I stop to work on my legs a bit, then head out to meet my family.  Big hugs all round :)

We head back to the hotel (another very busy tram, but well-organised by the marshals to avoid too much of a crush.)  There, I open my presents (did I mention race day was my birthday?), before heading to the restaurant for lunch.

At this point, walking has become pretty challenging, but I still feel great.  Next, it's a 4 hour car ride back home to Cambridge (thankfully I wasn't driving.)  On the way I can feel my legs stiffening, and wish I'd had time for a massage and/or a bath in Manchester, but it is what it is.

## What next?

The next day, I was walking like a constipated marionette, and descending stairs was only really possible in reverse.  Cycling was OK though, so I did a bit of that each day, and managed to get to the physio for a massage.

firstmarathon,"Hey folks, just under 2 months from my first marathon.

Training has been going well physically, but my biggest struggle is the eating. I'm a big guy/appetite even without any training, and now that weekly kilometers are &gt;40, eating enough calories in a day has gotten difficult (busy with work, lazy, etc.).

Any recommendations for meal plans or good/affordable meals/snacks? I'm not a picky eater, no dietary restrictions, and am happy to eat the same brek/lunch/dinner for a few days in a row no problem. 

My normal day right now looks like:

\- bulletproof coffee and shake in the morning with fruit, banana, peanut butter, all-in-one shake powder and collagen

\- lunch is random and probably where I need more structure. Usually leftovers from night before, tuna sandwich, soup/crackers. Upon reflection, it's probably too small of a lunch

\- sometimes some light snacking in the afternoon on nuts but not enough

\- dinner is usually something bigger, a big pasta, rice dish, etc.

Over the weekend I loaded up on eggs, nuts, fruit, frozen veggies/pizzas (I know not the healthiest but cheap/easy calories). I'm thinking of making lunch something more consistent like a big omelette, adding in heavier snacking in the afternoon and bigger dinner portions.

Any advice or tips are welcome!",Struggling to eat enough

I would love some race plan advice. I see there being three options:

1. Run at 3:50 hour marathon pace for the whole marathon. I like this plan as it gives some buffer but isn't *too* fast. The drawback is there is no pacer at 3:50 so I may be running alone.
2. Try to run at 3:45 hour marathon pace for the whole marathon, slowing down a bit if needed. The benefit of this plan is that there will be a 3:45 pacer in the marathon so I can run in a pacing group which might be beneficial for motivation. The drawback is that I'm slightly worried it might mean going off too fast and me paying the price towards the end of the race.
3. Run at 4:00 marathon pace for the whole marathon, planning to speed up a bit at the end of the race. This approach also allows me to run with a pacing group and conserves as much energy as possible which in theory I can use at the end to get ahead of the pacing group and finish with a small amount of buffer. The drawback is that I really don't have much buffer, which is a bit scary.

firstmarathon,"I haven't committed, but am playing with the idea of running a marathon this fall. I have two questions for any more experienced runners out there.

1: How do you stay hydrated on longer runs? I currently don't run longer than 4 miles, but any longer than that I definitely want access to water. Short of running laps or carrying a water bottle, I don't know how to keep water near me. I'd really like to knock out some longer sections of trail this summer which would make running laps impossible and the thought of carrying enough water for a 10 mile run doesn't sound fun. Any ideas?

2: Boredom. I have pretty serious ADD, so keeping my mind focused can be a problem. I usually do alright on trails because the scenery change, but when it rains and I have to run on a treadmill it's torture.

\- First Marathon Goal: 3:30:00 - 3:45:00   
\- 30M, 5K @ 20:25, HM @ 1:44 (MP Test, not all out).

\- Finished 20 weeks of base training (All 30+ miles, finished last 4 weeks on 40 miles).

firstmarathon,"Hi guys,

I have a bit of a unique situation so bear with me.

I currently run between 50-60km (sorry I don't know miles guys) a week - a mix of base, tempo, intervals, longer runs (between half-marathon and 25k every Sunday) etc. The thing is, I wasn't actually training for anything in particular - just enjoying getting the runs in. 

I'm about to start travelling for about a year or so - while I will of course continue with running, in most likelihood, I won't be able to stick to the same consistency. 

So, I randomly had a thought - there is a marathon about 5 weeks away. My fitness levels are good but I don't want to be cocky and just assume I can run a full marathon.

Do you think, I can pivot and run a marathon which isn't far away? My only major concern is that I haven't ran any longer runs of 20 miles/30km+. Time isn't that much of a priority - 3:45:00 would be great.

firstmarathon,"I just completed my first marathon, the Austin marathon, in 3hrs and 49 minutes (8:46 min per mile avg). My goal was sub-4 and Austin is a pretty challenging course, so I am stoked. 

I am 23M. I have always been in good muscular shape but was never a big runner. The longest I ran before this race was ~4 miles. I also shattered my ankle 1.5 years ago and had surgery to repair it. I trained for 4.5 months. I was determined and trained hard, but was not very consistent. I did about 3 runs a week, one long run (slow), one medium length run (at pace), and fast interval runs. 

I got carried away and started getting shin pains in the first month. I adjusted my running form to land on the balls of my feet. This adjustment took a few weeks to get used to. I then developed runners knee after hitting my first 15-miler. My concern over the injury held me back from running for a week and a half. I never reached my goal of 20 in training.

I ran the first 15 miles at ~8:30 pace. I started slow but felt great. Mike 16 my right quad gave out… horrible burning sensation. I ran through it; it “subsided”.

1. Prioritize sleep
2. Be strict about progressive overload 
3. Get to 20 miles in training
4. TRAIN LIKE YOU RACE - eat the same and where the same stuff

I also ordered the Tailwind powder to put in my water since this is an easier way to get some carbs and sugar without having to deal with eating and am looking forward to trying that out. I find that I’m generally just really not hungry during my longer runs and for a little while afterwards. 

I’m wondering if should get gels and if so how often to take them? I know to a degree it’s individual but I have no experience doing this. I ate the dates at miles 7 and 10 of a 13 mile run and that definitely made me feel better the remainder of the day but I don’t know if I should be taking in more during these long runs and I only have so many to play around with. 

Curious what other peoples experiences have been?",Nutrition / gels

firstmarathon,"This morning I completed the Melbourne marathon on a beautiful summers day.  Got warmish at the end, 25degrees, but not too bad with a 0600 start.  It can get 35 degrees regularly in December here so not too bad.

The course is a great one.  Starting in the sporting precinct near Rod Laver Arena (Centre court at the Australian open), through the city at the start then down through a long tree lined boulevard.  Around the Grand Prix track (it’s usually a road), then up and down the beach for about 15km then back to the city, with a finale in the iconic MCG (legitimately one of the worlds great sporting venues).

I had a plan to try and get 4:30, with a goal to run the whole way.  Everyone said whatever happens don’t go out too hard, but I couldn’t really do that anyway because there were so many people in the general public group.  No waves, just elites then weekend warriors.  I had plenty of gels and had one every 4km, which felt like a good plan.  Then slowed down a bit to make the most of the water stations.

Legs felt great the whole way.  With 8km to go I felt like trying to push the pace, with a few rolling hills toward the end.  Might have been a mistake, after the 38km marker I started to cramp badly and tightened up, gritted my teeth and rolled home.  

All in all a 10/10 experience.  The longest I ran in prep was 30km.  A lot of my kms were in the 12-16 range.  I might have been a bit short of conditioning right at the end, but I’ll learn from that. 

Had the pleasure of seeing the top guys running the other way at their 30km mark (1hr 45).  Boy were they motoring.

\### Training

I started training off the back of a 10km Training Cycle hitting \~25mpw consistently with a long run \~8-10miles. The only previous race results I had to go off of was the recent 10km of 48:40 (7:50 pace) a HM of 2:05 (\~9:35) in 2018 (from July 2018 - December 2019 I did not run consistently). Going off of Jack Daniel's Equivalent Running Calculator my Marathon finish time should be somewhere between 3:30:00 - 4:18:00 (\~8:30 - 9:50 pace).I decide to shoot for the middle and try to go sub 4:00:00. I went with Sage Canaday &amp; Sandy's ""Beginner-Intermediate Marathon Training Plan"" since his training videos on the 10km worked out so well.

&amp;#x200B;

It was a 16week training cycle that went pretty bad tbh. It was a busy 16 weeks for me that included: 3 weddings, a family vacation, and 3 work-related out of town trips. In that time frame my wife also got sick with covid-19 and my toddler caught a cold twice.

&amp;#x200B;

At week 11, I was only able to go above 20mpw for 3 weeks. Not good enough. With 5 weeks to go, I knew I needed  a change of plans so I switched to James Dunne (physical therapist on YT) free Marathon training plan. It basically came down to hitting 30\~42mpw for the next 5 weeks and building my long runs progressively to 13mi, 15mi, 17mi, 19mi, 10mi (taper) and changing the goal to sub 4:40:00. I was able to hit the 15,17,&amp;19mi long runs and that gave me some confidence going in.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Pre-race

The forecast for the race was 42degF @ starting and 55degF @ the finish. I sweat a lot and run hot so I decide on a Tshirt and shorts. Ate my usual bagel with cream cheese &amp; banana with coffee. I didn't do much research about bag pick ups or anything, so I was freezing my butt off before the race - lesson learned for next time.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Race

Miles 0 - 9

Since it was pretty cold I decided to go out at 9:00-9:30 pace to warm up and then drop down to 10:30 pace. I had a podcast playing and it felt pretty easy, HR around 145. My hands are freezing the whole time... I should've brought gloves.

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 10 - 13.1

The podcast ended and I put on some EDM (big mistake). There are some hills and I'm attacking the uphills and downhills because I'm just so pumped from the music. I'm feeling really good, I think ""maybe I can go sub 4:00 since I'm tapered"". I cross the HM at 2:03ish and I notice that my HR keeps spiking above 170. Crap, I need to pump the brakes.

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 13.1 - 16

I drop my pace to \~10:00-10:30 and take walk breaks whenever my HR spikes above 165. Attacking those hills and going out too fast was a huge mistake. A rookie mistake, everyone says not to go out too fast, D'oh. Aside from my HR being high \~160, I'm feeling relatively good.

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 17 - 20

Starting to really struggle now. I need to shorten my stride length because it is difficult to lift my legs. It isn't painful yet, sort of like DOMs after lifting heavy weights. The walking breaks get longer because my HR is spiking from 165 to 189! I've never seen it that high.

&amp;#x200B;

Miles 21 - 26.2

Here comes the pain. It is in my hips, my hamstrings, my calves, and my left foot. I'm pretty sure I have a stress fracture on my left foot. HR is consistently at 165\~170. I don't know if I caught up to the 4:35 pacers or they caught up to me but we're running together now. They are nice people, older (50s+) and chatting and happy the whole time. They really helped me get out of the funk that I was in. I tell myself, ""no more walking breaks &amp; stop looking at HR."" I relax into the best shuffle I could into the finish line.

&amp;#x200B;

\### Post-race

I could barely walk to the finisher's area. I am absolutely starving and devour 2 burritos. Once I sit down, I could not get up until 20 minutes later.

&amp;#x200B;

Looking back, I'm happy I decided to race anyways despite the crap training cycle. Life happens and training cycles will never be perfect so at least I know that I'm capable of running 26.2 miles. First mistake is obviously going out too fast and attacking hills. Second mistake was not bringing gloves and a vest. I thought that I would warm up, but my hands were frozen solid the entire time AND I was carrying my phone. But overall my for my first marathon it was a great experience and I had a lot fun! I counted 6 bands and 3 DJ booths that came out to play music along the race route. I hope to build off of this training block and race some half marathons and ultimately build up the mileage to return of 2022.

Background / Training
I signed up for this in 2019, to complete in 2020, but obviously that changed. I had only ever run a half marathon (untrained with a 2:13 completion 🤭). I ran a lot during quarantine but my go to has always been a mix of HIIT cardio and strength training. I started Hal Higdon novice plan at the end of July with 18 weeks to train. I followed it pretty to a T until November where I got injured, then sick, and finally did my first taper week at altitude so cut into some of the runs. My easy/ long run pace was 10-10:30, my tempo was at 9:44, and I did a few 10ks around the 9:15-9:30 pace. My nutrition didn’t change much except for trying to add in more carbs before / after long runs. I didn’t keep up my strength training during the marathon training, which for the next one, I think I would do. I maxed out my long run mileage at 20, and even though the plan had 2x20 milers, I completed one, and the other I did 18+2 mile walk. Having injured myself earlier I didn’t want to risk exasperating it. My only *major* mistake I think was getting competitive with my brother over Thanksgiving and doing The Incline in Colorado Springs with a week before marathon. 

Pre-race
I drove down the night before, feeling good physically aside from some anxious stomach issues. I had no appetite so I ate a met-rx bar and smoothie for some easy carb dense foods. I laid everything out and tried to get to bed early so I could get up at the ass crack of dawn to eat pre race. I tossed and turned all night, slept mostly from 2-4:30, when I woke up to eat another bar + banana + coffee which had been my pre long run breakfasts. Packed everything up, my hotel was 0.5 miles from the start, so I jogged over for a warm up. The weather was a humid and sticky 66° at the start, with fog and promise of rain. 

Miles 1-6.2
I got myself stationed near the 2:15 half marathon pacer, and out the gate, felt like everyone was passing me, I promised myself to not get caught up in everyone going fast, I wanted to start slow and use the first 5 miles to warm up. I settled into a rhythm of watching ahead, seeing the curves, enjoying the crowds, and bopping to my music. I had set a goal to not even look at my watch until 5 miles, and instead focus on how I felt. I have two parameters to go off - am I in control of my body (arms loose, striking at the right place, longer strides, etc) and is my breathing even and through my nose. I felt good, so I just held my pace. Surprise to me - at mile 5 I was holding around 9:30, and I had thought I was closer to 9:50-10. I still felt good so I planned to hold that pace, staying with the people I had been running with. I had my first pack of gummies at mile 6, drank at all the water stops, and kept my head up.

Miles 6.2-13.1
The energy was so fun, there was a hill around mile 7-8, that threw me in for a loop, some people stopped to walk it but I was determined to run it. Put my head down, felt like I was walking a 15% incline, but made it to the top to find the rest of 8 was downhill! I had built a strong playlist and was just vibing. Tried to hit all the water/Gatorade stations, had more gummies at mile 10, and was so excited to see someone handing out pickles 😍. It started raining at mile 11, which felt really nice but made things feel slick. The whole draw of Rock n’ Roll is the live music, I personally didn’t feel like it added much to the atmosphere, I was more into the signs / crowd, and tried to smile / interact with as many people as I could. My whole pack of runners were apparently half marathoners, so I was completely alone when the route split at mile 12, there were few and far between runners near me, and the crowd dispersed, so this is when I knew it was going to be a mental challenge.

Miles 13.1-17
I hit a downstrike at a weird angle and my left hip popped and I was in a LOT of pain, every strike after that was filled with a sharp pain, I was terrified of the fact I was half way. I was almost in tears and just focused on “one step at a time”. That became my mantra for the next 4 miles. I kept saying it over and over, telling myself I knew it would be hard, physically and mentally, and this is when I had to prove to myself I could do it. I hadn’t trained this hard, for this long, to stop now. I slowed my pace a little, got back into control of my breathing, and focused on getting to the next mile. I had more gummies at 14, water and Gatorade, luckily I had brought some ibuprofen with me, so I took a couple and kept my head up. Every left step hurt, which was the only thing I focused on during that time, I couldn’t tell you anything about the route, conditions, music, etc. We were running through a park, and there weren’t any major hills, so for the most part it was “smooth”

Miles 17-23
My left hip was numb now, so I started to pick up the pace, had more gummies at 18, I had been looking for my family but hadn’t seen them so I had almost given up hope of seeing them. I was enjoying the scenery and had started to pass people, lots of people had started walking, and I knew if I stopped to walk even for a minute, starting running again would be near impossible. My right knee was achy, probably from compensating for my hip, I kept drinking water, and had started to dump a few cups on me just to get some relief from the thick humidity. As I was coming up on mile 21, I hear my name!!! I see my sister cheering me on, and that gives me a boost to pick up the pace. This is the first time I start breathing through my mouth, just to stay in control and not completely out of breath. I have more gummies at 22, knowing it will be the last ones, drink some water, and get ready

Miles 23-26.2
Major. Freaking. Hill. Basically all of mile 23 is a slow increase uphill, and I am in excruciating pain. This is my wall, I had read that 90% of a marathon is the last 10k but I hadn’t felt that way yet. I have tears in my eyes, but I keep a smile on my face, otherwise I will probably start sobbing. My breathing gets choppy, as someone that has asthma, I can feel an attack coming on which almost always brings on a panic attack, so I know I have to get it together. I slow down, I loosen muscles, starting at the top of my head, until I get to my feet, this takes about a mile, my slowest mile, but it was worth it, I feel calm, controlled, and within a reasonable limit of pain. I talk to some people as they trudge with me, we all know it is a “chin up, one foot in front of the other” till the end. My brother send me a text that lights up my watch, he was my swim coach for a while while I was competitive and knows just what to say to light that fire. I make a promise to myself to get my pace down for the last two miles, but not to look at my watch. I make it a game, find a person, try and pass them, I stay in control of my breathing but allow the out of breath feeling to happen, it’s 2 miles, I do that in my sleep, that’s nothing. I am lucky there are no more hills, I get water to dump on me, I am waving to everyone, smiling through the pain. The last mile is my “this is what I trained for” moment, I am tired, hurting, I want to walk, slow down, but I do the opposite, i speed up, I’m seeing texts come in, I hear loud cheers, I am zoned into the path in front of me. My name breaks me out of my trance, I see my family cheering me on, run over for some final high fives, knowing I’m about 0.2 from finish I start sprinting. I turn the corner and the announcer is saying my name, I’m grinning ear to ear, race the finish, and cross at 4:12:02!!! I have tears in my eyes, pure joy, and pure pain.

Post-race
As soon as I stop running my hip lights up in pain, I am hobbling through as people hand me wet cold towels, my medal, water, Gatorade, trail mix, bananas, I hear my name, my mom is trying to get me to stop for a picture, I can’t stop walking or I’ll pass out so I just keep wandering, hear my dad say meet over somewhere and give him a thumbs up (I’ll find them eventually) as people congratulate me, all I can focus on is the pain. I waddle over to the post race festive, there’s music, I just keep walking, my body says sit, but I know if I do I won’t be able to get up, I go near the med tent just in case, once my family finds me I’m feeling 10x better. No longer dizzy, still in pain but I figured I would be for a bit. I take my shoes off (asses the blister damage), change my clothes because mine are soaked, get my shirt, and we walk to the cars. I eat a banana, but my stomach has cramped up, I feel sick from it so we load up, and start driving, we have to stop occasionally just so I can walk around, or go to the bathroom, but I fall asleep with my feet up. I spend the rest of the day with a stomach ache but aside from my hip, in a lot less pain then I expected. I take a bath with epsom salt and start researching where to do my next marathon.

firstmarathon,"I started my journey September 2020 in wanting to improve my health after a minor back injury had me horizontal for 2 days. I started walking, speed walking at that, got my time down to 7:30min/km, and by May completed a 50k walk on my 50th! Oh the pain over the last 7ks with cramps was nuts and really had me worrying if I would finish, completed in just over 7hrs.

Now after I finished the 50k and the 3-4 day recovery of not being able to sit on the you know what properly, the plan was to complete a Marathon as a runner within 12 months, again like my 50k, I didn’t really understand what I was getting myself into, but decided it would be great to do the Marathon in the same year, so that left me around 6 months of training. Found the latest Marathon I could find, and the date was set Dec 5th.

So from only walking, and never running longer than 5-7k on a treadmill 5 years ago, or longer than 3-5k even back in my youth 30 year ago, probably closer to 5k that I can remember, my journey began.

I struggled to 2.5k continuous running, got it to 5k, but run, with walk jog build in, to after finding an online coach, quickly to 5k, 10k, 15k, all the way up to 33k for my longest run 3 weeks out from the race. I had been trying to run too fast and slowing down was amazed how quickly I could run further. The plan he had me on was initially sub 6hr but we got that down to sub 5hr. I also love tech and bought myself a Stryd power meter, it was great, really enjoy all the stats and with the help of my coach and the pod got my cadence much higher that helped avoid my knee pain.

It was about 6-7 weeks out I did my 1st trail run, and horror thoughts entered my mind after navigating the 11k distance with 319m of elevation, how the F… am I going to run in December 42.2k with 1130m of elevation and really in the back of my mind thought I was absolutely stupid. Running on the flat ground to now, I had a false sense of achievement and here I was going to challenge a trail course with 1130m for my 1st Marathon!

I had also sucked my daughter to join me for the Marathon, 29 years my junior I thought it would be a great memory for the 2 of us, also for her 1st Marathon, she’s fit, but more cross fit style and longest she had run was a few 10ks.

Race day, I was nervous but excited and ready mentally for what lay ahead.. well I thought so anyway. Leading up to the day, we’ve been belted with lots and I mean lots of rain, the night before the race, we had another downpour that stopped around 1-2am at the course. Start time was 4am in complete darkness. So not only was it a trail run with elevation, but with all the recent rain what was the ground going to be like? The officials had changed the course 4 days out due to parts being too dangerous, we would now have 3 laps, rather than ½ Marathon track twice once in each direction. The good news we ran the course in the same direction for each lap.

Goal: My training with my stryd, putting in all the variables had me at around 4:12 for the race, I was happy to crack 5hrs…. Little did I know of the venture ahead of me.

All prepped on the Saturday, I was able to get to bed at 7 for a 12:30am rise, couldn’t sleep too much, up at 12, final preps and out the door at 1:30 to arrive by around 2:40am.

We kicked off in darkness compared to the city, the sky was simply amazing with all the stars popping out, after the storm it cleared to a near perfect sky. From the start it was pretty sloppy, lots of muddy spots, even some big wet areas where we all tried to navigate in single file, 87 started, 72 would finish. 

The plan was to run with my daughter see how we were after 1st lap if she was struggling to keep up, then I would let her run at her pace and I would go on ahead. Course was amazing, felt really good for 1st 8.5k, then we entered hell. This was like nothing I had done with my practice runs, for the next 3.5k we would be going down 38 degree declines with around 47 degree rises, well according to my stryd after the race, we had 3.5k, 170m down with 175m up…. And we still had two more laps of this…

Nearing the end of hell, I was now pushing my daughter, the ½ marathoners were to commence at 6am and I didn’t want to get stuck behind 150 runners on the 1st sloppy section, it would be a nightmare. Luckily, we made it back, and I decided to take off and let my daughter run her race. By the end of this section, I was slowly starting to feel it in the legs, with all the mud build up on the shoes they were starting to feel a little heavy. Our 1st lap of 14k we averaged 7:37/km, I thought if I could run a bit quicker I’d be on track. 

17ks in and slight concern how I would handle another 25ks as I was all of a sudden feeling a little in the legs, by 19k mark 1st cramp came on, my inner quads were really feeling it and also in the hamstrings… All sorts of images went through my mind, but giving up wasn’t one of them, I was out to prove to my daughter also that I had the fitness to finish, she had made a few cracks leading up about if the old man can do it, I should be able to! 

22ks quick pitstop with the emergency guys, and they showed me a stretch that should help, stupidly I hadn’t allowed any cramp meds, so they advised I get into the salt chips. Going through the 2nd Dungeon (hell) as it was called and the downhill was really hurting the knees and quads, one extremely lovely lady asked if I had any meds, and I said no, unselfishly she grabbed out hers and gave me 4 pills of something, I was ever so grateful and swallowed them down, within a few minutes the pain had lessened and I was away and able to get run again… well for a little while, the uphill also was now feeling it in the hamstrings too, I had to be really careful not to take any big steps, so really focussed on small quick ones to put less pressure on my muscles.

28ks two laps down, palm full of salt, another runner had some vinegar spray for my mouth, and again had full of chips and final lap ahead of me.

By this time, I was just trying to keep putting one step ahead of the other, I had to keep going, the cramps would come, I would stop quick stretch, then walk it out, to then slow jog and repeat! 

Met amazing people along the way, and this really helped take the mind off the pain. My fear was if I stopped for too long, the I would really freeze up…. So as much as possible I would try to keep up with whomever was around.

I had got to the Dungeon for the last time, 3.5k of hell and all up about 5.5k to the finish line. I wasn’t going to let it defeat me. My daughter was around 1km behind, this also helped push me knowing if I slowed too much, she would catch up, getting out of the Dungeon I knew I would finish, a feeling of emotion hit me and I teared up, I wasn’t going to be defeated, I was cheered on by some lovely ladies at the last support area, just on 2k to the finish line, I started to hear their voices and I got to within 30m of the finish line and knew the right thing to do was wait for my daughter, so I stretched, and paced a little for 8mins or so, and there she came, she smiled as she caught up, I knew she was also hurting, it was all over her face, we ran the last 30 mins and did it!! We just finished our 1st Marathon, not any marathon but one full of so many experiences we’ll both never forget!

In life we are hit with challenges my legs were toast, but it was only pain, I knew they would recover. For anyone yet to do your 1st Marathon, embrace the journey and experience, you’ll learn a lot about yourself, and it’ll make you stronger!

So…. what’s in store next, time to start planning the next challenge, my other daughter 3 years younger I joked about doing it again with her in 3 years! She reckons it won’t take 3 years… oh boy, she’s got no idea of what’s ahead of her!

Take care everyone and happy running!

firstmarathon,"Thoughts from my first marathon...

Miles 1-20: I feel good. I'm hitting my pace or under every mile. Was hoping the rain at around mile 6 or so would let up.

Mile 21: I've got a three minute cushion. What could go wrong. (Back begins to get sore and legs get heavy.)

Miles 22&amp;23: I can give up 20 seconds a mile and still make it in well under 4 hours. 

Mile 24: This is hell on earth. I'm gonna lose my goal. At this point, I switched my watch to average pace and being nine seconds up on the goal pace necessary, I was allowing myself to lose one second of that while I walked a few steps before picking back up amd running to get it back down as soon as the clock ticked down.

Mile 24.5: These four hour half marathoners are having way too much fun and I'm pretty sure they're all buzzed from the free booze. They should enter the full next year. It will kill their joy. 

Mile 25: I can walk and then run as fast as I can and survive this bonk. 

Mile 25 1/2: Not today Satan. I'm getting this time or they're gonna scrape me off the street.

Mile 26: I can see the finish. I'm not going to die. I've got over a minute to spare. (Does 4 Horsemen sign and then Arn Anderson's signature throat slash mannerism for the finish line camera to signify killing it and getting under 4 hours.)

Mile 26.2: Unexpected sobbing and weeping. 

Entering the finish line party:Where's my marathon finisher hat. 

Heads to hat stand: I hope there aren't steps over there. 

Gets to hat stand area: Crap, there are steps. (Group of older women who just finished the half are giggling I navigate the steps. Then, they realize I had finished the full.)

1 hr after the finish: A Macualy Culkin ""AAAAAHHHHH"" when the water hits the chafed places (inner legs and under my arms where my singlet was) for the first time. 

Pretty sure I'm never doing one again. I'm so content with my experience, my time and how I only really struggled for two amd a half miles or so.

I used Hal Higdon's novice or intermediate plan.",Survived and thrived overall... 3:58.56
firstmarathon,"My initial goal was to complete the marathon. My second goal was to run it at around the average marathon time of 4:20:00 and my stretch goal was a sub-4 finish. If I finished sub-4, I probably wouldn't run another one but now I feel obligated to get that sub-4 time. 

I used the Hal Hidgdon Novice 2 training program. At the same time, I've been cutting weight from 217lbs to 180lbs, currently 184lbs. Here is a break down of my training long runs and their elevation gain.

**Long Runs:**
• 11.00 - 1:55:53 - 1,069ft (10:32)
• 12:00 - 1:54:47 - 1,136ft (9:34)
• 14.00 - 2:16:01 - 1,366ft (9:43)
• 15.00 - 2:13:53 - 1,323ft (8:56)
• 13.1 - 1:51:00 - 1,006ft (8:28)
• 17.00 - 2:45:36 - 1,510ft (9:44)
• 18.00 - 2:59:36 - 1,746ft (9:59)
• 13.1 - 1:55:53 - 1,232ft (8:51)
• 13.1 - 1:54:09 - 699ft (8:43)
• 20.00 - 3:17:32 - 2,363ft (9:53)
• 13.1 - 2:03:08 - 1,466ft (9:24)

My training course included two decent grade uphill runs on each mile, hence the elevation gains. I was hoping that would have helped me more than it did with marathon course that had a ~900ft elevation gain.

I hung with the 4 hour pace group until around ~15 miles and then I guess I started bonking hard and my pace dropped to around 13:00-13:30/mile at mile 20 before stabilizing. My race supplementation were some energy jelly beans and water at the hydration stations sparingly.

Not sure which program I want to use for my next attempt, probably one that would allow me to keep a &lt;9:09 pace well past the 15 mile mark. So perhaps one of Hal Higdon's intermediate programs. I would also like to get back to 200lbs. So a sub-4 marathon at 200lbs would be my next goal.

It was fun though!",Finished my first marathon. 4:43:46.

firstmarathon,"I just need to vent. I never thought I could like running, and now I am depressed because I can't. 

I started running in 2020 for the first time. I decided a month in to train for a marathon, because, you know, why not? I worked my way through a number of injuries, which isn't surprising since I was seriously an anti-runner until I turned 51. I did get my first marathon in (Muddy River Marathon in southern MO in May). It was a wonderful and horrible experience - I did all my training in cold weather and the marathon was on a bright and sunny day in the 70's. I hadn't trained with water (I never got thirsty) and I ended up getting super dehydrated. Stumbled through the final 6 miles and after I crossed the finish line, I was wracked by full body shakes (had to be put on a gurney and rehydrated).

So, I decided I had to do it again, because, again, why not? It had to be better the second time. So I did the full training again, this time with hydration and fuel. No injuries the entire training cycle. I even picked up over a minute-a-mile on both my long aerobic runs (hr&lt;148) and my uptempo runs (hr&lt;160).  Then, just as I was entering taper, my foot started hurting (top of foot between the metatarsals). It would only hurt when I ran and for a couple days after. I could walk forever, but couldn't even jog lightly without it kicking in. I iced it, I rested it, I did needling and taping, I did everything I could. Ended up having to back out of the Little Rock Marathon last week (I walked the half with a friend - which was fun, but didn't take away my disappointment). 

Now, I'm sitting around waiting for my foot stop hurting. I'm in the best shape of my life, and I'm sitting here instead of running out there. Now, I'm finding out that this is kind of normal. I hear, ""Running is great, as long as your not injured."" Y'all, why didn't you warn me? I have fallen in love with running and it seems like it is destined to just break my heart.

That's all. I needed to get this out... because, of course, I can't talk about this with any of my other friends because they don't run and if I talk about running too much I risk losing the only friends I have left... which is another complaint I have - no one warned me that people really hate to hear about my running, no matter how excited I get about it. In fact, the more excited I get, the more they are like, ""Dude, why are you always talking about your running? You don't hear me always talking about my drinking, do you?""

For now, I am thinking of training up to an early spring half using the Nike Run Club app half marathon training program, basically as an excuse to build base over the winter, since I just started running consistently again.

Ran the Philly Marathon and felt good (ish) for the majority, until mile 22 or so when the wheels fell off. I had a fuel plan that I had practiced multiple times during training but the bonk hit like a ton of bricks, and I felt like there was nothing I could do. I also had my food plan for the days/weeks before the race and felt like I had all of that under control...I was honestly more worried about my problematic IT band being ugly, which thankfully it wasn't today (see separate conditioning loss post). 

I slowed way down, took 1-2 minute walk breaks, and slogged through the finish, feeling like I had 20lb weights strapped to my ankles. Even when it got down to .75 or so it felt impossible.

firstmarathon,"I just need help reconciling with this. I just ran the Richmond marathon and it was my first one. I ran it in 4:18. 

I ran my 20 miler 4 weeks prior and I killed it. I ran it at 7:49 pace and felt incredible. I probably cramped up a little bit at like mile 19 but that was it.

In the Richmond marathon, my goal was a 3:30. I went out at about 8 min/mile feeling really good and then around mile 10 I started feeling tweaks in my calves. From there it all kinda went downhill. I began cramping all over my legs and had to stop and start basically from mile 16 to the finish. I didn’t even have a chance to hit the wall or chafe or feel any other marathon pains because I just couldn’t run long enough without cramping. At one point around mile 23 I literally tipped over and rolled on the ground because there was no way for me to move my legs without cramping some muscle. My parents handed me a banana, I was taking Nuun frequently, I got a Gatorade from the Med tent, some nice people gave me salt tabs,  literally nothing significantly helped with the cramping. 

Now, after my 20 miler I developed a pretty bad blister that kept me from running too long for ~1.5 weeks. And if I’m being honest I didn’t do too many hard runs and my peak weekly mileage hovered around 30-40. I didn’t train as hard as I should’ve… but damn a 4:18? I’m really having a hard time understanding the discrepancy between my distance training and my marathon. Even my worst long run was no where near this bad. I just feel bummed out and disappointed that I put a lot of effort into this marathon and it kinda ended up being a disaster. And I really don’t understand why I started cramping so early.

firstmarathon,"Hi all!

I'm planning to run the Philly Marathon in just 10 days, on Nov. 21. My first marathon!

Background - I've been following the Hal Novice 1 pretty religiously. My original race was supposed to be Oct. 31, but it was cancelled due to the pandemic, so I adjusted training a bit to account for the 3 extra weeks, maintaining 30-35 MPW - ie a 18 week program turned into 21 weeks. All has been going pretty well, except now...

Now that the race is SO CLOSE my IT band has been acting up. I cut what was supposed to be a 12 miler down to 5 last Saturday... then felt OK today and ran 4, but now the outer hip and knee pain is much worse. Last Saturday I was barely able to walk and today is the same, even more intense. 

I figure I have 3 options, and was hoping for some advice:

1. Do I say F it and keep pushing through my training - running 6 tomorrow, 3 Thursday, 8 Saturday, then 3-4-2 next week? And make sure I do plenty of stretching, foam rolling, Advil, praying etc.?
2. Do I take the rest of this week and potentially next completely off, still doing the above stretching and the rest?

Wondering how much conditioning I'll lose by taking this week/potentially next week off and if its worth pushing through the race. I had horrible IT band syndrome about 6 years ago and it took a full year + PT to recover. Throughout training I have had little flairs that die down so I am hoping its just that... but ugh!

My legs felt like lead at mile 20 (esp with the bridge) and I just felt like I could not get enough water in me. Any tips for getting through that last 10K? training betteR?

## Background

I was a NCAA division 1 rower in college so I always thought of myself as a good athlete but had never really run long distances. The longest I had ever run was 8 miles on a treadmill which doesn’t really count. 

I read the book Can’t Hurt Me by David Goggins and it inspired me to try out long distance running. It was August 2021 and I wanted to run the NYC marathon because I’ve lived here all my life. The only way I could get in was through a charity entry at that point and I was lucky enough to find a team with a great cause that would take me.

Everyone told me I didn’t nearly have enough time but I wasn’t in that bad of shape and my goal was to really push myself mentally and physically so I thought this was the perfect opportunity.

## Training

I went out for my first training run on August 26th to try and complete one loop of Central Park (6.7 miles). I did not make it the whole way and walked a few times in the middle. I realized I had a long way to go and was not nearly as mentally or physically strong as I thought I was. 

I started reading this sub and researching everything I could about long distance running. I found a few plans online and did a mix of them making sure I hit the right amount of miles per week. I started visualizing the dreaded Harlem Hill in Central Park where I had the most trouble on my training runs. I would think about the hill at work and prepare myself for it mentally.

Within a few weeks I was running up the hill twice without stopping as part of a two loop half marathon in Central Park and I revised my goals. 

I became dead set on breaking 4 hours and told my family that if I’m not at the finish line by 4 hours to check the local hospitals. I was trying to prepare myself mentally to be willing to die to break 4 hours. 

I finished up my training and went into Taper and was definitely on track. I started imagining myself breaking 3:50 or even 3:45. I went to the NYC Marathon Expo and was excited to start the race. 

## Race

I woke up on race day at 4:45 and headed out to my bus to the start. I made it to the village at about 6:30 and still had way too long until I was scheduled to start at 9:55. I don’t know why they assign you a bus that gets you there so early. 

I laid down next to a tree with the blanket I brought and listened to the audio book that inspired me to run. Hearing Goggins story about running 100 miles on no training got me ready to go and after a few porta potty trips I was at the start line. 

I saw a few people I knew from growing up in the city but didn’t want to say hi bc I was in a very determined mindset. Everyone I knew heard that my goal was 4 hours and while most don’t have a concept of marathons I couldn’t deal with being above 4.

I got on the Verazzano bridge and had no service. My playlist wasn’t loading and my gps app wasn’t working. The gun went off and there were still so many people between me and the start that I knew my start wouldn’t could until I crossed the line but I wasn’t sure how that worked. I kept trying to get my gps app to work and crossed the start with my head down on my phone and trying to still run at my pace.

My gps and playlist started working soon and I figured it was about a quarter mile in so I could work backwards and figure out my time. he first few miles I was enjoying myself and trying to keep my heart rate under 165. Was giving high fives and pointing at fans and slowing down whenever my heart rate got too high.

My GPS said my first 3 miles were at 8:50 pace so I knew I could run above 9:10 the rest of the way and still break 4.

About halfway through I forgot that my GPS didn’t start until a few minutes into the race. I knew the mileage was off but I thought the clock  was right, I forgot that I didn’t even start the clock until a few minutes in. I crossed 13.1 at 1:55 on my gps time and thought I was in a great place. Just had to do 2:05 for the second half.

People started to walk on the Queensboro bridge but I chugged along with no crowd and sprinted down the ramp on to 1st avenue. My family and friends were all set up along this avenue every mile or so and going over to high five them and race by them gave me so much energy.

Going into the Bronx mile 20 I was under the impression that I had an hour left to run 6 miles. I thought no problem and I’m probably breaking 3:50 with a good sprint.

I started getting really tired and at about mile 23 was content just running 10 min miles home and getting under 4. I completely took myself out of the determined mindset because I thought I already hit my goal and was easily under 4. 

In Central Park I picked up the pace and ran hard to the finish but was already feeling the accomplishment of sub 4. My GPS said 26.2 miles at 3:55 and I stopped it. I had about 800 meters to go in the race and tried to run past a few people but not injure myself.

## Post-race

When I finished I figured I was 3:56 to 3:58 so I felt good but my body was destroyed. I sat down and was happy the people were so nice about not making me move. I looked at my phone and saw congratulations texts along with the number 3:59:56 being texted over and over again. I gave my family and friends my bib number to track me.

My jaw dropped. Did I actually cut it that close? I took my foot off the gas at the end when I was training for an all out sprint. I felt kind of disappointed that I got so caught up with breaking 4 that I forgot to really push myself the way I wanted. 

I had a lot of fun and learned about myself and the addictiveness of long distance running. Next time with a goal of 3:45 I am determined to actually push myself to my limit during the race.",3:59:56 First Marathon in NYC

firstmarathon,"Hi everyone!

I've had the goal for a while and now finally will get to it: Run a marathon!

Pre-covid I used to run regularly, mostly 10km in a 45-55min pace. I've seen Hal Higdon's training plan proposal [https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/marathon-training/novice-1-marathon/) to get in shape for a marathon, and am wondering how it combines with my regular ice-hockey practice tuesday through thursday and a game on the weekend.

I feel capable of running the program in the morning and going to practice in the evening, but I'm not sure if that's not too much for the body over a longer period of time, or too much to actually get in shape.

Has anyone prepped for a marathon or even half marathon while doing a physically intense sport?

My plan is to continue Week 14 as normal (instead of the 12 mile runs, I'm just doing a half-marathon). Replace the Week 15, 20 mile long run, with the missed 19 mile run. Replace the Week 16, 12 mile run, with the 20 mile run. Do another half marathon long run on Week 17 and run Week 18 as prescribed.

I'll be participating in the Athens Authentic Marathon on **November 14th** (10 days from now).The capped **time limit is 7 hours (\~16:00/mi pace)**, so I'm hoping I'll be able to finish it by using a combination of running and walking. My plan as of now is to switch off between running 4 miles at a 10:00/mi pace and walking 0.5 miles at a 30:00/mi pace. Assuming my plan doesn't fail me, I should be able to complete the first 22.5 miles in 4:35:00. That'll leave me the last 3.7 miles to finish at a \~39:00/mi pace.

# About my injury and (prior) training:

I got a *minor* knee injury in late August while bouldering, and haven't been comfortable running until maybe a week and a half ago. I had been running regularly starting in June, and had gotten my long run up to 11.5 miles at a 9:40/mi pace (I felt fine the day after the run, and the run itself was comfortable). During the period of no-running, I was hiking regularly (had a couple 10-15 mile days), and was otherwise active e.g. bouldering. I did a half-marathon back in Dec 2019 and finished in 1:49:50.

In the past week and a half, I've gone on a couple 3.5 mile runs, a couple 5 mile runs, and one ""long"" 10.5 mile run at a 9:40/mi pace.

My question:  
***Should I be training at all during these last days before the race?***

I know a taper still involves running at a lower-than-usual capacity, but I'm nervous that any running (3-8 miles) I do now will hurt me more than it'll help me.

Registration began today, and as soon as I got the announcement email which I was anxiously waiting for, I registered!

I was finally able to restart two and a half months ago, after my neurologist managed to get the migraines under control. I have a half-marathon in late November and another in early December, and I wanted a marathon goal by spring.

I was aiming for 4:55 but finished at 5:45. Stayed on pace during the first couple of hours running through the San Diego neighborhoods, so many people out cheering and great vibes, and then feel off once the course veered away from Mission Hills and the other neighborhoods.

The race officially started at 6:45 but I didn’t get out until 7:30.

Then had this weird thing happen with my carefully curated Spotify marathon playlist where it wouldn’t play the playlist was was instead playing songs from only one band which I really didn’t want because the mic keeps me engaged in the music so I ended up carrying my phone instead of using the arm band so I could maneuver through the playlist. Finally around mile 15 Spotify got the hint and stayed with the playlist. 

Kept me plan of having a gel every 3 miles and refilling my water bottle every few miles too and grabbing a quick breather; especially over the last several miles.

I had a good base of 30 to 35 miles per week and planned on doing 7 weeks of training but wasn’t able to taper properly because I tweaked my ankle 10 days out. I think that was a shoe issue and switching to some broken in Ghost 12 - about 197 miles on them before today - worked like a charm.

The goal of the race was to break 3:30/finish.

Before the race:
woke up around 5:30, ate a bagel and a clif bar, got dressed, and did a 15 min jog to wake up the legs a bit. It was colder than expected (45*F) and I have Renauld’s so I lost a couple fingers! I was still super excited.

I came back, got into my race attire + a sweatshirt and jogged to the start line around 7:00 to meet up with a couple friends. We got some drills + strides in and talked shop for a bit before heading over to our corral and taking our Gu’s.

The Race:

Environment was absolutely electric! Thousands of people were out for the first few miles and I kept having to remind myself to chill out a bit as I came through the first mile around 7:35, but I was comfortable and in a mass of people still. I continued to cruise at around 7:45 until about mile 4 when I met a new running friend who was going the same pace as I was, so we kept ourselves relaxed and distracted through the beautiful sights of the city!

Passed through the first 13.1 at 1:41:55, way under my goal pace but I was feeling incredibly fresh and positive still. All of a sudden we were pretty alone as the half racers finished and the wind started to pick up as we headed north on Neil. I took my third Gu of the day at 14 and was chillin as our paces stayed between 7:40-7:45/mi.

Saw some friends at 17 and started to think about when I was going to make a move, and decided to hold off as to not blow up to early. We fought up the only hill and got into Upper Arlington feeling strong still!

I broke off from my running partner at around 19 and dropped my pace to around 7:20. Temp was getting up to around 65* which was still nice but it meant I was sweating now. 

At around 21 I made my move on a long straight stretch and went 6:51, 6:45, 6:41 and felt great until it felt like my left foot was about to explode, as my legs weren’t used to running in racing shoes for that long.

I began to hit a bit of a wall around 25, but by then everyone was fighting so I forgot about pace and just tried to hunt down as many people as possible. Came through the finish line at 3:18:15 and was ecstatic! Last 13.1 was a 1:35 and I passed 127 people in the last 15k while being passed by 0!

firstmarathon,"I have never been a good runner. I remember in high school, it was difficult for me to run a mile I. Under 10 minutes.  

On Saturday I completed my first marathon in 5:35. My moving time was actually 5:20 because I was waiting for my wife and kids to meet me at mile 16. To me it was 100% worth it to see my family before continuing. 

I am thrilled that I crossed the finish line. I have done many century rides including the Triple Bypass. The Triple Bypass was much more exhausting to me but the marathon was WAY more painful.

firstmarathon,"Did my first marathon today in under 5 hours (Yorkshire in York UK) which is what I was aiming for! This how it went.

I ran the first 10 miles at a comfortable, relaxed pace that seemed a bit too slow. I chatted to a few other runners at this stage, felt relaxed and happy and able to keep going.

The next 10 miles, I pushed the pace a bit. I set my sights on a person in front of me, overtook them then ran steady for a bit, then repeat etc. I had a bit of a meltdown on mile 19- self doubt set in and I started to panic. I checked in with my body and it felt achy (as you'd expect) but I realised this was my mind letting me down, not my body. 

The last 6.2 was awful! It HURT. I gave up and walked, and realised walking hurt more! 🤣. I caught up with the 5 hour pacers and they got me though. They were amazing! 

I walked through every aid station up to mile 20 to allow the water/electrolyte drink/gel to settle in my stomach.
I could feel hot spots at the bottom of my feet (about mile 17). I took my shoes and socks off and put them back on with the laces slightly tighter. Those things may have been a waste of time but I felt like they helped- I've got just one tiny blister on a middle toe.

I had 7 energy gels, 2 small bottles of electrolyte drink, and about 5 small bottles of water (I discarded some ftom thd bottle if I didn't feel thristy) and a few sweets from the crowd. I had a massive bowl of porridge, an electrolyte drink (cheap supermarket own brand) and a cup of coffee for breakfast.

I wore Asics Nimbus 21s (bought just 6 days ago to replace the same model), Bridgedale socks, Asics 5 inch shorts, and my charity top.

I've raised well over £300 so far for Mind Leeds (a mental health charity).

When I crossed the finish I cried so hard. I was so proud. It was worth it! The medal is gorgeous.

Hey all! Fairly new (covid inspired) runner here. Looking for your words of wisdom / general good vibes after I failed my last pre marathon long run. 

I’m running NYC in November, and as per my training plan, today was supposed to be my longest pre-marathon run at 22 miles. The next few weeks are 10/8 mile tapers. 

Two weeks ago I did 20, which was a pretty big jump up from my previous high of 15. It was tiring, but never painful or anything like that. Afterwords, I felt great.  

But since the 20, my lower legs have been incredibly tight, and I’ve been unable to do anything more than five. After lots of rest and foam rolling I set out to do 22 today and ended up stopping at 2 with terrible shin splints. 

I know lots of people have their longest pre marathon run set to 20 but I was really hoping I could do 22 to get through the proverbial wall. 

Should I try again Monday? Or just start tapering? Any advice would be very appreciated.",Failed long run

I’m thinking the best move might be to rest for a week and maybe try a little run next Wednesday. I’m not aiming for a time, I’d like to finish in 5 hours, so I don’t expect a week of rest to be that detrimental.

firstmarathon,"Hey guys! I was the gal asking if I should wear my new sneakers (that came in the mail the day before the race) for my marathon due to some foot pain I thought was caused by my worn out sneaks. I did put my old inserts into the new shoes. The post generated some interest so I wanted to update anyone curious of doing the same. 

Full honesty: my shin splints hurt worse then ever before which led to full numbness of my feet and shins until mile 10. I don’t know if that was due to the sneakers but it definitely could have been. An extremely mentally tough way to start.

Buuuut mile ten onwards I was cruising and regained full feeling back and had a super enjoyable, painless rest of the run. Perhaps it took about ten miles to break my kicks in? Maybe it had nothing to do with it because I’ve been dealing with shin splints on and off for the last year? 

Would I recommend? Hm. No. The last 15 miles were great but holy shit the first ten were tough and I don’t know if that was worth going through if it was because of the sneakers. But who knows! Maybe the last 15 would have been terrible with my old sneakers.

I ran my first Half marathon in Dec. 2020 at 2:03, my 2nd this past June at 1:57, and I am currently training to run my 3rd Half just before Thanksgiving with a goal of 1:55. I was originally shooting for a time of 1:50, however I had a minor leg injury unrelated to running this summer which slowed me down for a while and I had to scale back my pace. 

I will have a few weeks after this upcoming Half to recover and then begin an 18wk training schedule for the Marathon. **Right now I'm looking at the Hal Higdon plans and considering either the Novice 1 or 2.** My understanding is that the only difference between them is that the Novice 2 has slightly more mileage overall and includes a pace run every other week. 

I think the slight increase in mileage is probably doable, however I'm not sure how I'd approach the pace run considering I don't have a solid run time goal. How have you picked a time goal for your first? I've seen online calculators that take your half time, double it and then add in a certain percent for every mile to your pace. For example mine might be 4:45. I would just be guessing at this point, though.

Spring, got an injury, went to physio who thought it was a punched nerve in my back. Stopped running, felt good, started over c25k. Progressed through the summer to 10k.

I'm now working through the Garmin half marathon plan and I'm a little over half way through Greg's plan. My legs and hips are pinching here and there like when I had my injury but most runs feel decent when I get going. I just notice that I'm quite a bit slower than last year. 

The half I signed up for is 10 days before the end of the plan.  When my pain gets to be more than feels manageable I've done my long runs as a long walk. Hasn't happened much though.

Is it normal to have aches and pains through the training? I'm guessing as volume increases its normal to be sore?

The blister backstory:

I shuffled some of the long runs around and did a half marathon (my first ever!) today. I felt well prepared with the training, fuel throughout was on point (2 caffeinated Huma gels and plenty of water), and cruised in at a 1:38:46 (about 1 min 45 sec slower than my target, but I was using my GPS watch to track splits and it didn't line up with the mile markers and my math was a little off - oops!). It was hot and sticky but I felt really good mentally and the race kinda flew by1! Was a good confidence booster for the big race. 

The one thing that was \*not\* ideal was the gnarley blister that developed on the bottom of my middle toe! Thankfully I didn't notice it much during the race but when I took my socks off... lets just say I lost some serious skin - its pretty raw. It is odd/annoying because I am running in the same shoes and socks I've been training in all along, and have completed longer runs without many issues - minor blisters here and there, but nothing crazy. FWIW I run in Mizuno Wave Sky Waveknit 3 shoes and Balega Comfort no-show running socks.

firstmarathon,"Well, its been an interesting summer of ""Marathon Training"" (I say that in quotes as its not really gone as planned).

Rewind the beginning of COVID...Around May 2020 I began running (its been awhile since I ran regularly). I started with a Couch to 5km, then tackled 10km and then about April 2021 I ran my first Half Marathon. Immediately after completed the Half I decided I wanted to complete a proper Marathon. Ran casually into May and started a 12 week beginner Hal Higdon plan in June.  


Overall I have been disciplined in not missing my long days (maybe 1-2) but summer holidays combined with work have created some hiccups -- too many than I would like to admit. Longest run I have done to date was 28km last weekend, 25km the weekend before -- long I have spent on my feet in a single run was about 3.5 hours. I had planned to do a 32km yesterday but been sore lately and decided on a slow 20km instead -- starting my taper a day earlier than original plan (my logic -- right or wrong: did not want to risk injuring myself on a 32km for the mental benefits of conquering that distance).  


A week ago I almost had convinced myself to switch to a half marathon...decided %&amp;# it, I will regret not trying. I have read that the last 10km of the marathon is the worst -- that terrifies me a bit as once I get close to 30km I am beat haha.

firstmarathon,,"For a sedentary 19 year old, do they need to start walking a lot before starting to run?"
firstmarathon,"I'm about 11 weeks into the FIRST plan (16 weeks total), training for my first marathon. I have no kind of running background, but this is the third time I've trained in some capacity for this marathon due to covid and various reschedules, so over the last year and a half I've run a lot more than I did in the past.

I have been very consistent about doing the prescribed long runs, but pretty inconsistent on the other two runs. I would say I've averaged more like 2.3 runs a week, rather than 3. I also go to the gym 3 days a week and do weight lifting and some other HIIT type workouts.

I have also not been very consistent with the pacing for the training runs. When I set out, my goal was a 4 hour marathon, which would have me doing the long runs in this program at close to 10 minute miles. This felt excruciatingly slow, and I really doubted that it would translate into being able to run 9ish minute miles for 26 miles, plus I was just not good at pacing myself, so most of those runs have been between 9:15-9:30 average paces. Yesterday I did 15 miles at a 9 minute pace.

Everything I'm reading has made me pretty skeptical that 4 hours is a reasonable goal, so I'm just trying to calibrate and also figure out a race day strategy. I try to run negative splits, and start out fairly slow. If I want to hit 4 hours, I would imagine running the first couple miles on race day at around 9:30 and then picking up from there, aiming to get to around 9:05 for the vast majority of the race. A more realistic goal to me is seemingly like maybe 4:15, as I think I would be a lot more comfortable sitting around 9:30 for most of the race with a bit of buffer if things get rough at the end.

I guess I'm just looking for advice, especially from anyone who has tried to do this on minimal training. I know most people believe in putting in large numbers of miles, but I'm not interested in giving up my other training goals and I want to minimize the potential for overuse injuries.

firstmarathon,"I understand the concept of running slow and comfortable to extend your miles. I get that I should be able to hold a conversation and if I can't I'm going too fast. My question isn't so much about the why but the *how*. How do you run at a slower pace without sacrificing form? 

Now, I was never the fastest but I do have a track background. I'm used to high knees, elbowing swinging hard, and light on the balls of my feet. I can slow that process down to about a 8-10 minute pace but I'll get winded after 3-4 miles. 

On the other hand, when I purposely and forcibly run a 10-14 minute pace I easily double my running distance; however, my hip and knees ache the entire time. The next day I'm sore as hell. My main issue is when I running this slow, I feel I'm not as light - landings hard on my feet and affecting my knees and hips.  

In the moment, I feel like I'm going just a tad faster than a speedwalker but with the same motion (except not adherring to the ""one foot always on the ground"" rule). Knees barely lift, landing in the middle part of my foot rather than balls of feet, and hips aching. 

Am I doing something mechanically wrong or is this a normal learning curve I need to get past and allow my body to get accustomed to the ""new"" jogging form. 

If it matters, I've been trying to get into long distance running on and off for about 2 years; currently going about 7 months strong. Weigh 240ish and stand at 6'2"". In the past I've also been a avid cyclists and ran short distances without knee or hip issues.

firstmarathon,"Longtime runner, training for first Marathon (MCM in Oct in DC!). I've done numerous 5K, 10K and 10 milers - and anytime I've tried to eat anything either before a long run or race day, it upsets my stomach and normally ruins the run or race. As a general rule, I eat a big nutritious carby dinner the night before a long run day or race day, and day of all I have is coffee with some nut pod creamer or half and half, plain water, and a liquid IV which has served me well so far. I have dabbled with taking a GU during a race but I don't know if it has made any difference, just kind if made me nauseous. With my no food approach, I feel great, run fast... and eat after. My long runs have gone up to 15 miles so far with my fasted approach and its been fine. 

I know this is not realistic for a marathon... so over the next few weeks I'm planning to experiment with food before long runs to try to find something that works. My questions:

&amp;#x200B;

1. How much time do you allow between eating and your run? Should I allow a couple of hours before my run or race?
2. What do you eat?? I realize this is largely individual, but as someone who really doesn't like breakfast at all (ha!) I'm looking for ideas to experiment with over the coming weeks.
3. Do you take any sort of antacid / stomach med prior to race to ensure your stomach is nice and settled for your race? Or has this backfired?

firstmarathon,"Hi All! 

I've always wanted to run a marathon, but also doubted that I could do it. I've always been athletic (used to dance competitively and fought amateur for a few years), but never explicitly a runner. I just turned 30 and decided this is the year I'm going to do it. The Honolulu marathon is inn 32 weeks (12/12/21).

I am not quite at ""couch"" level--I work out 4-5 times per week and am strong/lift--but I haven't run in like two years. I've never run long distance, like more than 4 miles.

So I want to use the first 8 weeks to get a base, then have a nice, gradual 24-week marathon training camp.

Has anyone done this and have any good plans? Or could any experienced racers comment on this one? [https://www.all-about-marathon-training.com/support-files/32weekmtplan.pdf](https://www.all-about-marathon-training.com/support-files/32weekmtplan.pdf)

firstmarathon,"Hi guys - looking to do first marathon in July. I started running in January with the initial goal of simply completing a marathon (longest run prior was 10 k once and that was extremely difficult). I realised that the times i was putting out suggested i may be able to do around a 4 hour marathon, though as training has continued this estimate has come down. 

I don't really have a specific target time in mind and when i asked r/running they suggested i complete a half first before taking a closer look at the target time question. So here i am, after two half marathons run (not races, just distance run in one go) asking what time i should be working towards. Or if that question has too many variables, how to best find out what time i should be working towards. I've run at a pace i feel comfortable running at and haven't tried to push myself - i'm goal orientated so if i were to push myself, i'd want to achieve a specific objective.

firstmarathon,"When British long-distance runner and gold medallist Mo Farah failed to qualify the 5000 metres final at the 2008 Beijing Olympics — an event he calls the biggest disappointment of his career — he took stock of everything and began changing his lifestyle.

Farah uprooted himself from Britain, where he had been living since he was 8 years old, leaving his wife, Tania Nell and twin daughters, and moved to Kenya for a training camp in preparation for the London 2012 Summer Olympics.

“I could easily have stayed in the UK with my family in a nice house, but I was willing to take a risk,” he told RadioTimes. Though it was missing the comforts of his home and family, the training camp in Kenya enabled Farah to totally focus on his goal.

“My room is basic: a bed, no TV. I wake up, run, have breakfast, sleep, gym in the afternoon, another run in the evening,” he said, describing his daily routine in Kenya. “That’s it, nothing else. No going to the café, no going for coffee. I just eat, sleep and train. When you get out on the roads and trails, there are big groups of locals running everywhere. They all run with great hunger. They know if they don’t, their families don’t eat.”

The lifestyle change paid off. Farah captured four gold medals in total at the 2012 and 2016 Summer Olympics, in the 5000 metres and 10,000 metres events, and has gone on to become one the most successful British track athletes in modern Olympic Games history.

On a typical training day, Farah wakes up between 7-7.30am, and has breakfast — he loves his coffee and cereal, in particular Frosties, “they gave me my much needed sugar rush to get me through the early part of each day,” he told The BBC. On other days he’ll have a couple pieces of toast with Nutella.

To read the rest of Mo Farah's daily routine, check out the full profile here: [https://www.balancethegrind.com.au/daily-routines/mo-farah-daily-routine/](https://www.balancethegrind.com.au/daily-routines/mo-farah-daily-routine/)","A look at Mo Farah's daily training routine &amp; diet: ""I wake up, run, have breakfast, sleep, gym in the afternoon, another run in the evening.”"

firstmarathon,[removed],How do you split your weekly mileage?
firstmarathon,"First-time poster here. Never ran a marathon, if I do it will probs be a ‘once and done.’ 

I’ve been a casual runner for 3+ years, with a few off periods. On a good week I used to run home from work once a week (7-8 miles) and do a couple 5k’s on other days where I might push myself for speed. 

Recently been getting more into it again. As part of that I did a long-run just to see how far my legs would comfortably take me and I did 9 miles. Been adding a mile onto my now weekly long run and today I did 12 miles! My long-runs are at a slow pace (10 mins per mile estimated), but I don’t stop. Then within a week I go for two 4 mile runs where I speed up. 

I was thinking ‘could I go for a marathon...?’ There’s one in my hometown in October. Taking the principle of adding 10% to a long run every week, in that sense it’s potentially achievable. 

But loads of training programmes say ‘you need to hit x number of miles a week’ maybe even outside of the long-run... 

Up until now I tend not to run two days in a row, just because I’ve heard that can be a healthy thing to do for your body. But with a typical training programme it looks like you’re doing potentially 10k a day? 

I’m willing to put the miles and time in, but just wondering what the best way of doing it was? I want to do it somewhat safely, as you hear these stories of people having cardiac arrests and such at the end of marathons etc... not that I’m paranoid, just aware of it. 

Would aim to finish the race running non-stop (pretty much). In terms of timing, if anything a sub-4 hour. 

I was thinking of maybe doing two or three 10k’s throughout the week, then my long-run at the weekend, where I add a mile every week? Is this not enough for my goal? If not, what might you recommend? 

TL;DR - first-timer, just looking to finish without stopping, possibly a sub-4 hour. Once and done. Best mileage to run weekly?",Building mileage/training safely?

The days I’m at home with the kids (2.5yrs and 7mo) are tough as well, as they’re usually up earlier than the sun, and my husband usually gets home from work a little later at night, leaving weekends the best time for me to run.

firstmarathon,[removed],"First marathon in 6 months, any advice?"
firstmarathon,"Hi there,

Just joined this group after sending an email to Nike run club and getting a bounce back and seemingly no way to email them about Nike run club app after searching their website. 

So in a nutshell, I was planning on using their app to train for this race, but their automatically generated programs include sprints which have to be tracked manually inspite of the app logging your distance. Ie. You get assigned 4 x 400m sprints, with 1.5 minute breaks, and even though you can look down at your phone and see it click over 400m, you have to manually press the button to tell it you've done 400m. This might sound like ""don't be fussy, just look down and check or measure out 400m"" but tbh I've tried to just bare with it, but I'm finding it clunky to the point of demotivation, and bottom line, if I'm not running due to app experience, it's time to make a change to make sure I'm doing my training. 

Anyone can suggest another app which can put together a training program for me for my 30km race coming up in around 4 to 5 months? Of course the race will likely be covid19 cancelled, but I'm just going to train for it anyway. I would really like the app to automatically log my sprints if these are part of the training program, or I'm just back in same boat as Nike run club. If only paid apps can provide this level of functionality, then that's fine. 

Really appreciate your advice on this folks :) 

If anyone has got this far, and wants to read my email to Nike run club which they will not ever read, it's as follows 

""
Hi there, 

I hope this finds you well. 

I've been using the Nike run club app for a while now, and I think it's great for the most part. Thank you for it.

I have always avoided using the sprinting or interval function, I expected that there would be a way to automatically log by sprints once the GPS to text that I've done the set distance or time. I have not tried to use this function for a couple of years and thought id check in to see if it had been improved, so I did a little experiment and watched the distance tracker as I did my first 4 x 400m sprint workout as the first part of a marathon training program over the next few months. So I watched the GPS tracker log my distance until I got to 400m, expecting that the interval would be mocked once they reached the goal of 400m, an alligator some kind of a notification like when I'm doing my distance front for every kilometre. But the time it just seems to keep running without regard to my having already completed the set distance. 

So I'm hoping there is a setting somewhere, all that I am just not using it correctly. is there any way to have Nike run club app in for me when I get to my milestones of each interval question mark for instance when I get to 400 m it could be and tell me that I can stuffs printing and take my 1 1/2 minute break. It's super awesome that are put together the program for me and that is logging my work out, but I just can't understand why it's not seeming to provide real-time feedback and updates on my intervals. I can understand the idea of having the ability to manually add interval markers for if for instance if your GPS wasn't working are you using a treadmill. But even stil, I'm not hearing any update as to whether I should be taking a break and walking as per the instructions before I begin the work out. 

it seems that the way it works at the moment is to read the instructions start of the work out and then keep them in your mind for the workout full stop for instance looking down at your phone to see if you've run the distance opening unlocking the phone to Mark the time and then keeping an eye on clock for the next sprint to begin.... one more thing Violet and there doesn't seem to be any included warm up comma for the sprint exercises, and as I don't really know what I'm doing when it comes to running I never feel confident in how long I should warm up for that these kinds of high intensity exercises. and where are developing an injury back not working out well. 

I'll try to make this work if that's how the app is supposed to work. But compared to the user experience of the longer runs where I get updates every kilometre it doesn't seem like it's been developed to anywhere near the same standard of quality. I'm aware it's a free app so I hope I don't sound entitled, thanks for taking the time to read this. 

Warmest regards,

My question is.. Is there a logical approach to juggle both hobbies? I enjoy both running and rock climbing and don't want to sacrifice one for the other. Most marathon training programs I've looked at have me running 4-5 times a week. Where can I fit rock climbing in? On short run days? On rest days? Definitely not long run days. Has anyone else accomplished this feat?

Thanks for your advice. The marathon in question in the San Diego Rock and Roll if you are wondering.","Thinking about starting training for my first marathon, but I just started rock climbing. Could I do both?"

firstmarathon,"Hi all! I have signed up for my first marathon this October. I’ve never run more than ~10 miles, and that’s been awhile ago. I recently had a baby, but did run frequently prior to becoming pregnant. I’m just getting back out on the road (even though it’s winter where I live currently), and have been doing some research as to a good marathon training plan for a beginner. However, I’m wondering, since I have 10 months until my marathon, would it suit me better to first train for a half marathon, and when I can comfortably run that, then start training for a full?

Hey guys,

So my friend and I want to run the LA marathon on March 8. Neither of us are runners but we have been running together the last 2 weeks about 5 miles every couple of days with an average pace of around 10:30. We’re going to increase our runs to about 25 miles a week with one long run each week increasing to 16 mile at the 3 week before marathon mark, then begin tapering. I know most of y’all’s opinion is that we’re stupid, crazy, dumb for even thinking we can do it but we’re going to, even if it means we might walk a lot. Any advice regarding how much we should be running and how we should be eating. I’m around 200 lb, 5’10.","First Marathon, not a runner"

firstmarathon,"Looking for long-term training advice on running my first full marathon in the Fall of 2021 (to celebrate the year I turn 40 and do so without feeling old), so in about 20 months. Here's some info on where I'm at today:

\*\*Distance\*\* - the longest I have ever ran to date is 10 miles, and I've down this I think 6 times now in the past 3 years (most recently, today). 

\*\*Frequency \*\*- maybe 100 miles / year for the past 2-3 years. I do a few organized races, in the 5k to 10 mile range each year. I'll train for them about half the time, and spread the rest of the runs out throughout the year.

\*\*Speed\*\* - I'm slow. Today's 10 mile run was at a 13:30 pace. My fastest 5k was 29 min and I have no idea how I ran that fast - I'm usually much slower. 

From what I've read ""marathon training"" is really focused on the 4-5 months leading up to the big run, so when I get that close I figure I'll follow one of those plans. But in the meantime - what should my goals for 2020 be, to build strength as a running in preparation for training the following year?

One idea I've had - 365 miles/year. That's a bit more than I've run in the past, but is it enough? Or do I have more catching up to do before I can be ""marathon training ready"" in 2021?

Also, what's the best way to split those miles up? Obviously some combination of short and long runs, but how far should I go this year, and how frequently should I be pushing my distance limits? At a minimum I'll do a half this spring, but should I try to go longer in the fall, or just focus on more frequent runs in the 10-15 mile range? The other idea I had was maybe I should work my way up to a 26.2 mile run/walk in the fall, even if that might take 8 or more hours with all the walking breaks that I'll need. Is that worth it, or is it better to more frequently run halfs until you are ready to start pushing yourself towards the full?",10 mile to full in 20 months

firstmarathon,"Before 2018 I only ran sparingly and didn't have systematic run training. I did 2 10 km races but finally stopped running about June 2018.

I resumed running September and decided to do my first half marathon, and within 3 weeks of training I pushed by 10 km PB down by about 2 minutes to 0:46:36, and another 6 weeks afterwards I ran my first half marathon at 1:41:50 without any ill effects. Then 2 days later I signed up for a full coming in 15 weeks (I deliberately give a longer time to this as I felt I slightly undertrained for my half, sometimes only 2 runs a week but I should be doing 3 runs a week with about 20 - 25 km / week, and also I have a marathon swimming race coming in 6 weeks)

My ideal training for the full will be about 3 runs / week (1 short interval speed session, 1 medium-hard long interval, and 1 easy-to-medium long run) after the recovery period, late December to mid-January, while building my weekly mileage from 20 to about 35 km / week, then after my marathon swimming race, increase to about 4 runs / week to 37 - 45 km / week until early March, then start to taper.

The first week after the half marathon was the recovery period, the race was on Sunday (8 Dec) and I only did a little running on the Saturday (14 Dec) afterwards, and then a 10 km medium-hard on the Wednesday afterwards (18 Dec). In my ideal situation I should do a long run of 17 - 22 km on 22 Dec but I was too lazy that I didn't have my running mood after swimming for 6.5 km. I have a holiday on 24 Dec but I'm doing an orienteering race on 25 Dec so I don't want to destroy my legs by doing a long run, so I'm currently planning to do it on 26 Dec, then I'll have a sprint orienteering race on 28 Dec again so I'll probably run again on 30 Dec and 1 Jan.

However, I'm not sure if I can keep my plan well as I missed quite a few times when training for my half, as sometimes I get too tired after my runs and/or my swims and want to have extra sleep, and running is not my favourite sport (I'm neutral about road running on a completely flat course, and I hate any kind of trail running / cross-country except in an orienteering race).

My training target will probably be running my first marathon at 3:40, and depends on my feeling I will see if I can try to push to 3:30 after my last long run. Is this too ambitious given my half time of 1:41:50 and training at about 37 - 45 km running / week (combined with 12 - 17 km swimming / week)?","Newbie here, signed up for my first marathon running and started training (but can't keep up the consistency)"

Hey everyone! 
I just wanted to post the training plan my running group used for this year. CIM was my first marathon and I definitely didn’t build up enough of a base before starting the program. The training plan itself is 18 weeks if I can count correctly.

They recommended that you can run at least 7 miles before starting. I was forced to taper off a lot more than I planned and didn’t participate in a lot of runs unfortunately. I think it does give you a good baseline for how to break up your mileage though.

firstmarathon,"Well, I jokingly told my friends I would be OK with rain or wind, just not both. And guess what I got! Race day was ~40 degrees, but with a steady, cold rain, and winds 15-20mph.

Not an ounce of me was dry, despite trying to get the best gear for the conditions.

Training:
I used Hal Higdon's beginner plan and was pretty happy with how I felt. I have some semi-distance background, with a handful of 1/2 marathons and 10-20k's under my belt. Im short and I'm slow, so I wasn't expecting much. I also really now understand the importance of the taper weeks. I've been battling some little issues on and off through the training. Not enough to miss anything, but enough to wonder if I was going to make it. I completely nixed the last 8 miler and kept the leading-up week super light. I think this was the right thing for me, as my body felt fine the entire time. My hip and knee didnt give me an ounce of a problem. Also, a testament to the program:  I had to swap around a lot of my long runs due to my flex schedule, and it worked out perfectly fine. I learned its ok to mix things up, just as long as you are getting in the mileage.

Race:
'The wall' is no joke. I found myself saying, ""wow, 20 miles two weeks ago felt easy, why am I at 15 and struggling?"" Totally a mental game.

I also really struggled with nerves, which is new to me. I had a hard time settling in the first 6 or so miles. My watch was really jumpy, probably in part due to the overcast weather, so I couldn't find my stride. I felt like I slowed down and sped up a lot. 

20-24 was rough, but damn I felt good 24-26.

Goal #1 was to finish. Goal #2 was to be under 5 hours. Goal #3 was to be 4:40 (Where I've been training.) I finished in 5:13. Kinda bummed about that, as I know I have more in me. But ehhhh... I finished a marathon!

All in all - I cant wait to do it again. Its a shame the weather really sucked, because I feel like I had a lot more left in me and I played it too conservatively in various places.

A little bit about myself, I just started running on and off around last summer, one of my friends said, let's all do a half marathon, I was like hmm okay. I never would have thought I would have completed a marathon. After the half marathon in July of 2018 1:59, I wanted more, so I signed up for 2 more on a whim and my times consistently decreased, 1:54 in April, and 1:51 back in September of this year. Then, I ended up signing up for a marathon. Here's a recap 

4:30am - Ahh shit, nervous laughter with random energy, I'm running a marathon. Slogs out of bed, does a little repeated extensions in standing. Gargles coconut oil, for all of you oil pulling fanatics.

4:45am - Brush my teeth, water, 1 peanut butter sandwich with half a banana, sip on some hot water.

5:00am - Left the house, made sure everything's in my clear bag, mental prep. My mom and her friends drive to Brooklyn to come through and support

6:00am - Arrive, walk on over to the bag check. Warm up, calm myself down a bit, look for porta-potties, they're past the security but they don't have porta potties before the security check smh? 

7:00am - Race start, start Strava, turns out I have to use the restroom again when we're walking out in terms of the corrals so I head to one really quickly before actually crossing the starting line

7:30am - Mile 3ish, someone drops his headphones, pick them up, I think, okay that was my very good deed of the day, not going to do any more for the month haha. 

8:30am - Mile 9ish, feeling okay, I packed some dates to chew on throughout the race, I think I was on my second one out of three

9:30am - Mile 15-16ish , feeling meh, random bursts of energy from my friends out on the sidelines. 

10:00am - Mile 19-20, I can feel my calves cramp up slightly, had to push, had to push. Then my hamstring, oh jeez. I try to push through, but I can feel my form let up a lot, I would put cold water on my muscles which was weird but it helped push me through. At times, my form would be okay, but then my muscles would cramp up. Huh, how does the big toe extensor cramp up like that? 

10:30am - Miles 20-23 Sometimes my form would be great, sometimes I would walk due to the cramps but otherwise I made it okay, not that bad to go to medical tents. It was like a jog-run-walk combo.

11:00am Miles 25 - 26.2 Wow, thankful for finding that guy who I ran with for the last mile or so, my form improved and I felt good to push it for the last .2. Relief, I did it! Never thought I'd run this far.

11:15am Would I do that again? Yeah, I want to push myself even further and finish strong and under 4 the next time. I get changed into fresher clothes. My friends and family head on over to grab some food. I think I started my taper waaay too early and I didn't really plan for nutrition. I ended up tapering 4 weeks before the marathon with the most longest run was 20 miles with half assed nutrition with 3 dates which left me really fatigued. I also didn't practice nutrition and when to eat on the marathon, so I ended up eating dates at 6 mile intervals without taking into account for gels they had near the race.

I never even considered that I could one day run a marathon, but things are looking up! And it’s become a goal I MUST achieve.

Since starting, things have gone mediocre really. I sprained my ankle, then ended up irritating a nerve because I amped up my distance too quickly when getting back to the trails. After that, I ran only ~3 times over the span of a month before a 10k race day on September 22. Needless to say, it did not go well. My time was 1:12. 

Doing so poorly, however, gave me a new motivation to get better. I’ve been back out lots over the past month, and am doing relatively good! My longest runs lately are about 6km with a 5:45-6:30 pace. I signed up for a 6k race this weekend, and am hoping for a personal record (of course).

However, for the past two years I would just roll out of bed at 5 and run. I never stretched and the only injury I sustained was from twisting my knee by landing wrong stepping onto a curb. However, with these longer runs I'm terrified I'm going to hurt myself so I've started trying to stretch. 

I don't do too much because I'm too eager to get running. I do 10 leg swings each, 10 butt kicks each, twenty steps on my heels, toes, and outside of foot each, and 10 lunges per leg. I do this as a warm up and cool down.

Hi all, been reading in this subreddit a lot and getting great advice but of course am looking for some insight on my specific situation.

Bit of background I signed up for a marathon in March, and started taking running seriously around mid March. I have been running consistently since then, logging in total about 600km since March, currently running around 40-45km a week with no issues.

I ran a half marathon last weekend at 2:02:37, my best 10k is 51:46 and best 5k is 24:36. I have been running a half marathon distance a couple times a month since July and due to vacations etc not always getting that but always running and doing some sort of long run.

With 4 weeks out to the full marathon what advice do you have? I know I should taper, and I’d like to get at least a 30km run in next Saturday to see how that feels.  I know the marathon is a different beast so am looking for some input from more experience runners.

firstmarathon,"Been doing my research on how to I can build a marathon training plan. So far this [article](https://hvmn.com/blog/training/building-your-marathon-training-plan) by Brady Holmer has pretty much helped me and so are the other articles I've read. So all in all, these are my thoughts: 

Building that weekly long-distance run is going to essential if you are trying to beat a four-hour mark --by the way, good luck that is pretty impressive-- so once a week go for a long run.  For beginners, each week increase this run by a mile.  After you have hit 10 miles per run you can increase the run by two miles.  


***Long Distance Runs***  
Week 1: 13 miles.. Week 2: 15 miles.. Week 3: 17 miles…etc

At this rate, by week eight you will be up to 27 miles, which is more than a marathon. **That is if you do not take any rest weeks. However, it is recommended that every fourth week you do**. According to runner’s world, weekly rests are just as beneficial to the muscles as daily rests.

Week 4: 13 miles.. Week 5: 19 miles.. Week 6: 21 miles.. Week 7: 23 miles.. Week 8: 13 miles… etc  
   
It is very important that you do not over train.  Studies have shown that three or four days of training a week is actually more effective than six.  So after your run, give yourself a day to repair, especially after the long-distance run. (Check runner's world for more detail: [http://www.runnersworld.com/arti...](http://www.runnersworld.com/article/0,7120,s6-238-244--11816-0,00.html))  


***Running HIIT***  
Personally I would incorporate a little bit of HIIT (HighIntensity Interval Training) into the first few weeks of training.  This type of training will blast your leg muscles into shape.  It won’t so much build the mental endurance that is necessary for a marathon; however, it will strengthen the legs faster than any other type of exercise, and studies show it does a world of good for cardio.   


* Run 200 meters full speed (this means all out, no holds barred, fast as you can.)
* Rest for as long as it took you to run.
* Repeat the process 3 more times.

If you want to incorporate HIIT then you will want to place it on the exact opposite end of the week from your long-distance run.  So if your long run is on Sunday then do HIIT on Wednesday.   
   
**Within four weeks of marathon day,  it is recommended to stop doing HIIT**.  This type of exercise is made to tear your muscles deep, and when it comes time to run the marathon you are going to want your muscles to be in pristine condition.  
   
***Nutrition***

Lastly, it is vitally important that you are eating the right type of foods.  If you are training constantly, you are going to need to get a lot of protein (around 70 grams a day) so that you can repair those muscles you are constantly tearing apart. It is recommended to have breakfasts with carbs.  This will give you long-lasting energy throughout the day.

Then eat veggies with dinner. It is a little known fact that protein cannot synthesize properly in the body unless you are getting the right amount of vitamins and minerals to cause those chemical reactions.

firstmarathon,"I have 6 weeks to go to my first marathon.

Through the summer I have been running with a camelbak to stay hydrated in the heat. 

For the hottest long runs in mid summer I was carrying (and drinking) 1.5 litres over 25-29k. 

The weather is thankfully getting cooler now so I don't anticipate I will need to hydrate so much, but how should I adapt to what amount of water I will realistically be able to drink on the day?

Guess I'm concerned that my body is used to getting water whenever I want, so will it be tougher if I run without the camelbak during the marathon. 

Secondly, I've been used to sweating and being hot all the time in the summer sessions but now in the fall I have started feeling cold on my runs and need to layer. Is this something I just experiment with until I find the right layers for the temperature so that when I run on the day I know what to wear?

firstmarathon,"Let me start by saying that no runner should get into situation like this, but then again sometimes worst things happen when you least expect them. 
I started preparing for this marathon 1.5 months ago. I had run few 10km races two years ago and I thought that running sport was quite familiar to me. I knew I wanted to  step up but I saw half-marathon as a distance which I could achieve easily. I guess the main problem from the beginning was that I was too confident in myself. I havent made specific plan for marathon training nor I asked no help from  professionals. I did some reading online on basic things and based on my physical abilities I made up a plan to just add 1 or 2 km everytime I run. I started from 11km run and built my mileage over a month to 25km with few breaks where I did not run at all. Its important to note that eventhough I did stretching after each run my warm ups for these runs were little to none. I just get up in the morning and instantly go for a run. The progress was quick and my pace was consistent, about 6:00/km and it always lets me to enjoy running. I never felt as if I was pushing to my limits. And I still havent had decided whether to sign up for marathon or not. It was two weeks ago that I thought why shouldnt I atleast try. I signed up, went for a few more runs following the same ""strategy"" with only one day rests in between and then reached 32km mark a week ago. The run was really fine, only the last 5 kilometres it felt like pushing through and I thought I would still go for last 35km run after two days. Well the following morning I got out of bed with a strong pain in my lower left leg. 'Its nothing that couldnt go away in a day' I thought and didnt worry much. But then I started noticing that it gets way worse after some walking and I do not feel as confident standing on this leg. My diagnosis was that I got shin splints and I started applying ice to the leg, massaging it, stretching the calves and doing different exercises. At this point I was really dedicated to do everything it takes to complete the marathon. Now that week passed, I completely reduced any physical activity of that leg and the pain is the same and only right now I have realised that what I have in my lower leg is tibia stress fracture. I considered trying to run with shin splints and pushing through pain, even if that would meant staying in bed the week after. But now I tried to run around, hop on each leg and the pain went from almost zero to the point that I cannot walk normally.  Just an hour ago I decided to put this marathon off and damn it is hard to do. I dont even realise how long will be the recovery but I know I wont be running for at least a month I feel miserable and regret every kilometre of that last run a week ago. Now that I went to pre-marathon event today its hard to believe I wont be among all those runners this year. It even feels more shitty because I know that I can beat that distance, I know that physically and mentally I am ready and prepared. Except for that damned leg which is result of my training plan and lack of proper knowledge.  I feel such a letdown for people who I actually invited to come support me but I dont even want to imagine myself quitting after 5km if I would still try to participate.
There were people telling that marathon is not a distance that should be taken lightly but I really believed in my ability to prepare on my own. Now I got a clear answer that Im simply not ready for it.

firstmarathon,"Hey everyone,

This is my first time posting here, so I hope I am doing this right. My story is below, and I bolded my actual questions at the bottom with a TL;DR.

I have been training for my first marathon for about 4 months now, and I am entering into the last month or so of my training. Everything has been going great so far and I have been feeling great, but about two weeks back I started to feel some pain in my left Achilles tendon on long runs.

It does not hurt at all when I am not running, and it hasn't been cropping up until about mile 5 when I do my training during the week. It isn't bad enough that I have to stop, but it has been bothering me and making me worried that I am doing some damage to my foot.

The pain started towards the tail end of my first 30k, and I was about 5 miles from home so I didn't really have a choice but just to push through it. As soon as I stopped running the pain stopped, so I assumed it was just my joints getting tired. I cut back my miles for the next week (my rest week) from what I had planned, and limited myself to what just felt best. I got an ankle brace and ankle sleeve and wear those throughout the day to take some of the pressure off. I started wearing the sleeve when I run, and it seems to work to a point. 

I am curious how worried I should be about my ankle, and if I need to drastically change my plan now. I am so late into my training I don't want to give up, but I am terrified I am going to rip my Achilles tendon if I am not careful. Everything I read online suggests waiting for two weeks before seeing a doctor, and this Saturday will be the two-week mark from when the pain first started.

This Saturday is also when I am due for my next long run (which will be my first 20-mile run).

The longest I have ran since my 30k was about 7.5 miles, and I haven't done more than a few 4 mile runs throughout the week just to stay loose.

I am afraid I pushed myself too hard on my long run week, or that I increased my mileage too much after being sick at the end of July. 

I did just get a new pair of shoes after using a pair that was shot for longer than i should have (I have giant flat feet, so I had to special order some and the order was two weeks delayed). So these could all be factors.

TL;DR - I am so close to running my first marathon and I ran through some tendon pain on a 30k because I am a dummy. Now my tendon hurts every time I run, and I am scared I am out of commission before I can run my marathon.

Now I'm male, 32 and I love running but have never ran more than 10k in one go. I'm pretty active and walk a lot but any running at all at this point seems like a bad idea since I'm about 50 pounds overweight. So my plan is that the weight will have to come off first and that's of course almost all diet. I do plan on going to the gym regularly in the next few months too, and then after new year slowly start the running - I could probably run a few kilometers now if someone had a gun to my head but even with my crazy Hokas the impact is just too much for any healthy running at the moment.

So the race is November 1 2020 - anything to aim for? At what point should I be able to run 5k or 10k or 20k? Or should I just focus on getting the mile time down? I have no real aim since it will be my first marathon but under 5 hours seems reasonable. Any running at all is months away anyway, any tips or words of motivation until then? The only risk I see is that it's so far away that I'll sort of cheat and procrastinate on the diet but once I'm comitted I'm sure I can do it.

My wife is a long time runner (a few half marathons as an adult, cross country as a kid) and she’s begun training for her first marathon this fall.

She has a solid plan she’s following but she’s struggling with calculating her target pace. She’s tried several calculators and they all say different things within a range of about 1 minute per mile.

Her birthday is coming up and I was wondering if there were any good places to look for a quick coaching session that I could gift her. We chatted about it and she might like to be able to talk or chat with someone with experience and maybe share some of her strava data to figure out what a reasonable target split should be.

If this sounds weird or like a waste of money, that’s fine too. I’m not a runner myself, but I’m in that sphere since she’s been in the throes of training for a bit.",Online coaching (gift for my wife)

I started training this March just for fun and am currently training for my first half marathon this late July.  I normally train three times a week on Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday (Saturday being a long run). My current weekly mileage is between 20-25 miles a week.

firstmarathon,I ran my first marathon on Saturday and while my time wasn't bad (4:03) I experienced cramping for the first time in my life. I was feeling really good and was running 8:30-8:45 splits until mile 21. Soon after I mile 21 I started feeling really sore in my hips which then spread towards my right quad feeling like it was gonna pop which continued til I finished. My right calf also cramped too. I was taking one gu every 45 minutes on the dot with alternating water and sports drink at aid stations. My next marathon is in September.  I had ran 20 miles twice in my training plan and had a 3 week taper. Any advice on how to prevent this problem in the future? Should I start using salt tabs? Should i add in further distances? More speed work? Etc? Shorter taper? I really want to go sub 4 and if I didn't have to stop and walk I know I could have done it.  Thanks in advance!,Cramping mile 21

firstmarathon,"So I am coming up to half way through a 22 week training program for my First marathon in Mid September. 

My mid week runs started out at 5km, progressed to 6.5km, then 8km but from next week they go up to 10km and in August they go as high as 13km.

My issue (I understand this isn't a big issue in any way) is that during the week, I head out for a run during my lunch break at work with a colleague (Not training for a marathon) which I would like to maintain the routine of, but 8km is the upper limit of the amount of time I can take off at lunch.

My primary question is what would the effects on my training be if I was to do a 5km run in the morning before work then another 5km at lunch, to make up the plan's required kms?
Would I need to do more total kms to replicate the training effects of doing all the distance in one go? Say 2x6km for when the program asks for 10km? 2x8km when it asks for 13km? Etc.

Just as a note, I do my long run on the weekend which when my mid week runs increase to 10km is about 25km to 28km and when the program increases the mid week runs to around 13km I will be doing a 28km to 32km run on the weekend.","Advice on splitting up my mid week (Run-days are Monday, Wednesday, Friday) runs so that I run two sessions a day on run-days"

 - speedwork would be tough because I don't have access to a stadium - I basically run around the neighborhood. So something like 
""2x200 interval, 4x400 pace, 6x50 treshold"" is nigh impossible because I cannot measure those distances accurately + I do not know hot to produce various paces with that level of precision on queue.

 - I'm generally fine training 5-7 times a week. Due to an office job the workdays should preferably be easier training. If I had to write a program from scratch, I'd just do daily easy runs in the morning with a long run on Sundays (~25-30% of the mileage for the week) and ramp the total distance every week.

 - The idea of walking breaks during training and racing does not appeal to me psychologically. I want to run. It's good to have walking as a last resort though (e. g. the half I ran last weekend - once I crossed 16km on schedule I knew that I had it in the bag no matter what, because from that point I could switch to walking at any time and still make the time limit).

 - I will be doing three more halves (end of May, start of June, start of Sep) before attempting the full marathon in early October. Goals for the halves is 2:00-2:10; maybe 1:50 for the third one depending on my progress.

Hello all, so I am running my first marathon this coming April 11th and unfortunately have fallen victim to an Achilles injury as of this past Sunday.  I cannot trace the injury back to a specific trauma so I believe it was just me being too ambitious since I felt great and added too much too fast.

The pain while walking is almost zero so I attempted to go for a SUPER EASY recovery run last night which confirmed my worst nightmare and I just can not run right now, it was a painful couple miles at a baby pace.  Anyways, runners of Reddit from your experiences what do you recommend firstly for specific rehab on an Achilles injury, the best way to approach starting to re-introduce training, most useful cross training and finally any other advice as far as mentally dealing with the injury and forced break in training?

I've posted before about my hip pain that started about 3 weeks ago and just kind of wanted to complain!I have a Dr. appointment on April 3, but until then I'm just trying to see what I can do to help my running. After a lot of pain on my 10 miler at the end of week 6, I stopped running for 6 days to allow my hip pain to heal. My first run back was 3 miles on Monday and while I could feel the beginning of some pain but it was about a 2/10 so I carried on without much of an issue. Yesterday I ran 6 miles and really began to feel pain from miles 4-6. The pain is on my left side of my hip and radiates into my butt area. The strange thing is that when I'm not running, I BARELY feel any pain at all. It comes on when I've been running for a while and pretty much stops when I stop.

firstmarathon,"Just a little background first, 

Currently a Physical Therapy graduate student, vegan, around 5'9, 150ish lbs. 

Little background on my fitness. I played sports in high school, ran track, swam, played basketball. When I ran track, I ran the 800m.  I never really aspired to run far distances a while ago when I was in high school. Then I turned to running by the lake for a little bit over high school after the track season, doing it as a hobby. Kept that hobby on and off running by the lake. By the time graduate school came around, one of my friends suggested running a half. Signed up and that was around a year ago. Finished 1:59. Then I was like, woah I need to run more. Signed up for a 5k a couple months ago and ran a 24:30. 

I signed up for a full because I felt like it would be a journey to run more and I want to push myself. In terms of health recently, current graduate student, I've been sleeping 6-7ish hours on school days, eating plant based, currently running 2-3x a week currently \~10mpw, following a yoga practice daily. I know I have to increase running 4-5x/week and increase mileage, that'll be hopefully starting May.  Considering any training programs, my goal is to finish, but not only to finish, probably finish and not feel dead. As a time goal, I'd like to finish around 4:40? (not sure if that's a good goal)

I'd be happy to learn any tips for training/nutrition for a first, specifically running the Brooklyn Marathon. I'd say my specific questions to those who run marathons:

I've been a lurker of this subreddit the passed 2 weeks (I wish I found yall sooner!)  Anyway, i'm running my first marathon in Taiwan this weekend - the Taichung World Flora Marathon.  Training, I would say for the most part has been as expected, good amount of ups and downs.  This consisted of failing to hit my 28km the first time around.  Successfully hitting my 35km run 2 weeks later.  And then tapering, I would say has been going well.  

EXCEPT 3 days ago I woke up with some slight runner's knee.  Reading that taking days off on the last week doesn't really affect overall fitness, I've been largely conservative this week opting for more massages, stretching and even went to the physio to get checked up and taped up.

Anyway, I just want to say thanks to everyone who contributes to this community.  I find everything informational and inspiring.  I know that all I need to do is stay focused and trust in the training.

Oh, and last but not least.  I just found out that it might be wet (drizzle) on the day of my race.  I've read that a cap and possibly a lightweight jacket or poncho is in order.  But I was wondering if there were any recommendations when it comes to shoes, socks etc.  I assume its 100% likely that it shouldn't really be much of a concern given there isn't much to do about it, but just wanted to check.

Any advice on a training schedule?  Or do you know of any resources I could go to to find this information?  Thank you in advance!",Training with difficult work schedule
firstmarathon,"I only found this subreddit slightly before I ran my first marathon, but I did get some advice looking through the history.  I figured I'd just give you my experience before the memory fades.  Someone might match up with where I was at so I'll start there.

Let me begin by saying I'm not a fan of running.  My wife refuses to accept that because I commit to it, but it's entry level exercise that keeps my BP down.  I also say that because I often hear ""I just don't like running""  or ""I can't even run up the street.""  When I started couch to 5k, I also could not run one single city block.  Every run I begin with the thought ""ugh, why am I doing this?""  But I do it, and if you have a health need or any other intrinsic motivation, you can too.  Signing up for a marathon really makes it seem like I do like running, I'm not sure why my brain decided it was a good idea to do one.  I am not a fan.  I am also over 40.

I ran 650 miles for 2018 total.  For me, that seemed like a decent amount.  Not earth shattering, but consistent running.  For a marathon runner that's peanuts.  Sometimes it would be a 10k, sometimes just a mile or two.  This time last year I ran the half marathon.  I was not prepared for that.  That was the beginning of my 650 journey last year basically, but I made it, and I thought ""wow, I will never do something crazy like this again.""

On 12/26, not even two months to go, a co-worker and I decided to jump in and do the full before the last early discount ran out.  That's not a good reason, but it is what it is and sometimes it sounds right in the moment.  I had been running consistently, and figured I would throw in some long runs and see what I could do.  My wife warned me that marathon training programs require more time, I was already late in the game.  She was right.  I still pushed forward.

I completely undertrained.  Going into the marathon this weekend my longest run was the half marathon a year earlier and a couple runs 10-12 miles.  I began to get a little nervous this past week.  Found this place, got more nervous and rightfully so.  I went on one last run with my friend, a 2.5 mile run just to keep pace.  That was it for the final week heading in.  Our plan was to keep 11:35 pace for the first 10 miles.  The course shuts down after 6 hours, if we could do that we'd have a shot at beating the next 16.2 miles before they closed up shop.

I dressed the night before, loaded up a fanny pack full of gummies and Vaseline packets, and tried to sleep.  Got up at 4:am, got to the starting line a little before 5, ate a banana and a bagel, race started at 6.  The first couple of miles went well, we tried our best to keep at 11:30, but we were closer to 11:00.  We got near the half marathon point at around 2:45 which was about where we wanted, might have been nice to be a little faster.  At mile 14, my friend had to stop due to cramping.  He ran only slightly less miles than I had the past year, but it was just not possible.  I pressed on.  About mile 15 I started to drag.  Every mile after that brought new levels of misery and mental challenge I didn't expect. 

It seems foolish to say a marathon is harder than you'd think it would be.  No one doubts the level of challenge, but still, it's really easy to underestimate.  I talked with a few fellow runners who were also struggling, most of them also first timers.  By mile 19 I passed a pub and looked over and thought, I'm just parking my butt in a stool and calling my wife.  It's not about admitting defeat, who cares?  Somehow I overpowered my mind to keep going.  

At this point, I've eaten a few gummies, definitely get some of those.  Also I ate one of those mix packets at a water stop.  There's no doubt you need something like this to get you through.  Every mile after 20 was a mental and physical challenge to a new level.  The sun had come out and was beaming down.  I thought I was on mile 22, but I was on mile 21.  When I reached the next sign and it said 22, I was so mad at myself for mentally adding an entire mile.  So frustrating.  At actual mile 22, I felt my legs wanting to cramp badly.  I kept thinking this is my body, I am in control, don't cramp.  Not sure if that was logical, but seemed to keep it under control.

I crossed the finish line running in the last .2.  Almost immediately after, every single muscle in my legs cramped.  Both of them.  I struggled to stand and a medic asked if I needed help.  He gave me some ice, a drink, and a banana.  I looked around and it was not good.  People were seriously hurt.  An ambulance roared away in the background, one of many trips from what I understand.  As soon as I could walk slightly I got out of the way for people that were in more need than I was.  I did it though, I finished the marathon.  And before the race was closed, if even slightly before.

I've had two of my serious runner friends tell me afterward they were completely surprised I was able to finish.  They said this because they knew the miles I logged going in, and that only makes it so so much harder.  This is the main thing I want to impart.  Some of you here are posting asking if you can do it with X time left before the start date with y running.  I don't even think I came close to the minimum entry level running for this.  I'd like to brag it was my determination, and it was (you definitely need a lot of that), but also I got lucky my body didn't just give out.  This is a major race and people got seriously hurt who looked like they had way more training than I did.  

TL;DR - Running a marathon is probably harder than you think to an exponential amount.  If you are asking if you have enough training, you don't.  If you really want this, get on a training plan.  All that said, I did make it, I'm proud I made it, and you can too.  Don't hurt yourself.","Finished my first marathon over the weekend, some thoughts"

firstmarathon,"We all know the basics. Run, Eat right, Drink water, Stretch, Repeat.. That is the easy part. 

The mental strength is the hard part.  While you are running your mind is going to try it's hardest to convince you to stop.  It's designed to do that to protect your body, you simply have to outsmart it.  I use the phrase ""JUST KEEP RUNNING"". It sounds silly but when the run gets tough (and it will) you simply think of that phrase over and over and over until after some time you realize that all is well and your still running. It Helps! You can also try counting.  Start at 1 and count to 1000.  These kinds of tactics take your mind off the running and the pain putting you on a sort of running autopilot.

 Another tip that works very well, especially on up-hills, is to pick a spot 25 yards ahead of you (a crack in the road, a leaf, a painted line, anything) and run to that spot.  Once you get to that spot (or mini victory) have a new spot picked out and run to that, then just repeat over and over. 

Just as positive thoughts will keep you going, negative thoughts will surely stop you. When you start to have the thoughts of pain, quitting, stopping, walking, understand that your body is only at about 40% of what it is capable of doing so get those thoughts out of your mind by doing the above and keep going!

BELIEVE IN YOURSELF and NEVER QUIT.

firstmarathon,"So I've been running for about the past 24 years or so to different capacities, in high school I run for boxing training, I was in the military and ran several sub 9 min 1.5 milers (these we're about 14 years ago) for PT tests but as of recent my running interest has been ramping up to now the first marathon.  I'm now at 34 years old and have been focusing more and more of my time toward short runs 5K and 10Ks and got up to my first half last fall which was probably the best feeling of my life.  Anyways looking back at my training over the past 2 years or so I sort of just went out and felt my pace for the day hitting 2 hard speed workouts (i.e. intervals, fartlek, tempos) and a long run on Sundays with my weekly mileage averaging somewhere between 25-30 miles only.  My goal last year was to get a sub 20 5K and I did that twice, hitting 18:59 for one of them, also my half marathon as I mentioned I ran in 1:28:54 which felt amazing, so I wanted more.  So this year I've decided to run a marathon and bought a training program where I believe like many of them have me running the greater majority of my runs at a much slower pace then I'm used to training at so the intensity is just not there for me and honestly I'm just not feeling it.  What I mean by that is I feel like I've lost the edge that got me motivated for a marathon in the first place because I'll go out for an 8 miler come back without feeling like its a workout.  I get that I need to build the base as I get up to 50 miles a week so I will stick with this but I'm seriously considering just throwing speedwork in to a couple of the runs here earlier than prescribed.

I've previously run 8 half marathons over the last few years and now I'm ready to step up to the big time!..I think!

I have signed up for a full in the first weekend of May.  I'm not really following any set training plan as I don't think I can quite do as much weekly running as they require, I play soccer 2 - 3 nights a week after work and up till now have normally been doing a decent length weekend run 8-12k (5-8 Miles).  My plan is to keep playing soccer and hope for no injuries, keep doing my weekend run and increasing distance each week and also add in a mid-week run of a decent distance as well.  My last 2 weekend runs have been 18k an 20k (11 and 12.5 miles)

I know it's not really enough k's in the legs per week but hopefully the soccer strength will get me through!

firstmarathon,"Hello, as you may know I am the ballerina wannabe marathoner!

So I did my first 'long run' of 6 miles, it was very fun and not so bad!!! I was so happy afterwards and I'm surprised lol I only stopped once for a red light but I was slow :D and I've been trying to run outside as much as possible (and did for the long run and a few 3 milers) but sometimes I have to run on a treadmill since it is kind of scary for me to run at night outside alone... is that okay for the shorter runs? It is super super boring but I think it would be worse to not run at all ahaha. I could try to run in the early morning instead, that way I can run outside always. I know you're supposed to train like the race (aka outside)  but when work gets in the way I have to run in the evening. 

Second thing is I have learned that I need to wear actual socks with sneakers not winter socks because that was painful and terrible. 

Third thing is I am very confused as to how to carry water with me on longer runs, the next long run will be 8 miles and I know I will want to drink some water so how do I do this? On the 6 mile one I was very thirsty at the end and drank a bunch of water when I got home and then felt kind of 'sloshy' if that makes sense...

Right now I'm looking at Salomon-- either the Pulse belt (minimalistic) or the Pulse handheld, which is my top choice right now. I've always had trouble with belts not riding up during my run, and the handheld looks pretty secure and has a pocket for gels, which is pretty cool.

I know it's cyclical because I've noted these runs over the course of training and they are exactly 31 days apart which is the length of my cycle. Also I have cycle-related insomnia which is not totally great for distance runners. So. Do you have these problems, or others because your ovaries and uterus are flooding you with idiotic hormones? Do you wanna talk about it? What do you do to not make your runs SUCK on those days?

firstmarathon,"So I plan on running the LA marathon late march. Currently I've been cross training, running four days a week and heavy lifting 2. My long run each weak is only 13 miles, I do that on a Saturday.

I plan on still lifting which might make things tricky, but I'm wondering what plan you'd suggest from Hal Higdon, and what tweaks I need to make since it looks like his programs are usually 18 weeks and the LA marathon is last week of March.

I have to say mentally, I've been dying around mile 10(lol). It just starts to become a chore, idk if it's the music I listen to or what. I'm a sprinter and switched to running longer mainly for health benefits. I'm male, 6' and around 195 if that matters. I also run the 13 milers at around an 8 minute pace, which may just be too much for me as it starts to become a chore.

Also I only run on treadmills, that might be part of what is driving me crazy around mile 10, but I don't live in a safe area so outdoors running is rarely possible.

Should I get a pair that is maybe more of a low-drop?  If so, I want to get them now so I can start wearing them in.

Also, I generally run first thing in the morning without breakfast no problem.  Once I started getting up to 16 miles though, I was feeling pretty fatigued.  I train jiu jitsu in the mornings when I'm not running and usually eat a couple strips of center cut bacon, egg whites, black beans, and a small spinach salad and have no problems when training.

I'm a male, 176cm long and I weighed 70kg - roughly. Anyway, I only ran once a week (long runs - sometimes the 13.2 miles) and I managed to finish the half-marathon in 2:04. **No injuries, no muscle problems.** I really enjoyed the experience.  


For personal reasons, I stopped running for a year. And 2 months ago I started preparing to run my first marathon in May 2019 - 20 weeks from writing this. 2 months ago, when I first started training, I followed the Hal Hidgson plan. Week 2 of the plan I had shin splints and a hip injury for the first time of my life. I really disliked running on 3 consecutive days, and my body just didn't take it well. I stopped running again to recover. And I am now on [this plan](https://www.runnersworld.co.za/training/foolproof-beginners-marathon-training-programme/), which I'm much more comfortable with.  


Anyway, **my pace on the 3-mile runs so far has been varying - it can go from 8:15 to 10:53** (I live in a super hilly place, so it depends on the route and how I'm feeling). **There's a bit of a psychological factor to that because I do enjoy the long runs much more than the short ones**.

1. How can I stop my quads from cramping after about mile 13? Every long run I've been on my quads seem to hit the wall between miles 12 and 15 and they both will simultaneously start to cramp, so I waddle for a bit and then end up losing time/rhythm to sit down and stretch them out for a bit. Never happens during short runs, and I've tries different types of hydration to fight it but nothing seems to work. Any advice? Worried that on raceday once they start to cramp they won't stop... which will be a rough 10-15 miles to end the race.

2. Is an ice bath or a sauna better after a long run? Looking to recover fast and kill a lot of the soreness. Obviously traditionally everyone says ice bath, but today after my 15 mile run I hit the sauna and then took a warm shower for about 10 minutes each and I walked out of there feeling super good.

firstmarathon,,I Ran A Marathon With Only Ten Weeks Of Training And It Was Intense
firstmarathon,"Hey everyone, I’ve posted a few times over the past few months as I was training for my first marathon (Chicago).  

Just wanted to update everyone and say that I survived. I was hoping to stay under 6 hours but had some serious cramping that resulted in a lot of walking towards the end. But at the end of the day my only goal was to finish under the 6:30 time limit. I’m happy to say I finished and I’ve had such a weight taken off my shoulders. The anxiety of this marathon had been overwhelming ever since I signed up for it last November. 

Having my parents, girlfriend, and best friends there to cheer me on was awesome. Also learned that running marathons is a super emotional experience as I cried multiple times during the race. Part of it was the pain but most of the tears were happy/proud tears as this was a huge deal for me. I guess I was just really proud of myself. 

Aside from the cramping the worst part was the rain. My shoes/socks were soaked before the race even started. 

I followed the Hal Higdon Novice Supreme program and it worked pretty well for me. However, most of my training occurred on a treadmill in the gym at my office. One thing I would change for the future is my nutrition both in general (I didn’t change my eating habits at all and lost about 50 lbs over the past few months) and during my runs. I didn’t use anything but water during my training runs so my energy/nutrition wasn’t on point. 

I know they say never try anything new on the day of the marathon but I chanced it and ate bananas (cramping) and all sorts of Gatorade chews/gels (energy). I’m not sure how much they helped but thankfully there was no negative effects. 

Now that it’s been a few days, I can finally walk again and most of the soreness is gone. It’s hard to say if I’ll do another marathon in the future but I still have another 30-40 lbs that I want to lose. I think half marathons might be more my style but there’s a little part of me that wants to apply what I learned through this process and apply it to my next marathon to see how much I could improve. 

This is admittedly a rambling post but I just wanted to put it out into the universe and thank everyone for their advice and input throughout this journey.

firstmarathon,,I Run Like The Winded
firstmarathon,"I’m just writing this in case it helps people who are either 1.) larger runners or 2.) training last minute and don’t think they can do it. You totally can!

Some disclaimers:

- I’m 6’ and 225, so I am technically obese. That said, I’m pretty muscular and look more like an out of shape linebacker. 

- 4 weeks of serious training, but I was in decent shape before that and was an athlete in college 10 years ago. So probably above average base. 

My tips: 

1. Let yourself train at a slow pace. I gave up the first time training because I wanted all my training runs to be at 8:00 pace. I became discouraged and stopped. My gf who was training hard (we were going to do the marathon together before I gave up), was like, “why don’t you just run 10 minute miles, that’s a respectable marathon pace.” I was like “REALLY?!” From then on, the curse was broken and I would run ~9:30s to train and felt good. 

2. Carbo load like your life depends on it. A week before the race, I knew I had to stack every deck in my favor since my training wasn’t there. My longest run ever in my life was a single 15 mile run. So I read the blogs and started carbo loading 3 days ahead. Day of the race, I woke up at 4am, ate a bagel and a power bar and a banana and chugged Gatorade and went back to sleep. During the race, I probably ate 8 gels and wanted to vomit. But I knew I needed every calorie and every gram of glycogen. 

3. Take tapering seriously. I followed the last two weeks of marathon training to a t even though I did not do the long runs or the other training. 

4. Stop drinking. I drank a reasonable amount, and stopping completely for a month made me feel like Superman. 

Summary of my training:

I had given up any idea of a marathon for about 2 months. Absolutely no running but some Peloton biking and some weight training. About 4 weeks before the race I was signed up for with my gf, I randomly went on a slow jog with #1 (above) in mind. I jogged for 9 miles slowly (9:30 ish) and felt good. I said, “that’s 1/3 of a marathon, maybe I  can do it.” 

I rested for a couple days and went out again. This time I did the exact distance of a half marathon. Again, felt pretty good but sore afterwards. Now there is like 3 weeks til planned marathon and now I am toying with the idea of just doing it. My brain now went from a 0% chance to a 40% chance. 

The next week, I decided to her long run with her (she was tapering and had a 12 mile). I decided to keep going after her and do 15 miles, which was the longest run of my life. This one was 9:15 miles with the last ones over 10. Although against the training schedule, I really feel like my body could recover in two weeks. This would be the bedrock of the actual race. 

From then on, I just did the regular marathon schedule as if I had been doing it all along. An 8 mile run the weekend before the marathon, and a few 4-5 milers. 

3 days before the marathon, I switched to carbs. Oatmeal, pasta, bagels, etc. I really went all in and actually didn’t like the way it made me feel. But I needed the edge. During the race, I slammed gels with reckless abandon. 

During the actual race, I just went out slow and steady and felt very good. Miles 16, 17, 18, 19 were all distance records for me and very easy at 9:30. I started to wonder earnestly what would slow me down and started running 8:50s and thinking about sub 4 hours. Started passing a lot of people who were now stretching and walking. 

At mile 22, both hamstrings started to clench. I reasoned this could end the race. If the hamstrings seized up, then there would be no running. So I sorta waddled it out from there with an awkward gate, running about 10 minute miles for the final 4. 

I crossed the finish line at 4:09 and felt pretty good. Needless to say, was nearly dead with soreness for a few days. 

I hope this helps anyone out there who is looking at last minute training ideas or who thinks they are too big for the marathon. You can do it!

firstmarathon,"Hi all! 

I'm running Philly in November and so far I've been doing pretty well in regards to training; I've only missed 1 long run, and had a 10 mile race last Sunday that reflected obvious progress in speed and endurance. However, throughout this training cycle I've never hesitated to take a couple days off if I feel a nagging injury or extreme fatigue (I have recurrent symptoms related to my cycle). As much as I hate messing with my schedule, I'd hate to withdraw from the race itself. And this seems to be happening yet again - after my 10 miler on Sunday I developed some sharp pain on the back of my thigh whenever I flex it and consequently I haven't run at all since Sunday. 

So, my question is: how important is it that I make up those missed weekday runs? Should I try and squeeze them in on Friday and Saturday before my 19 miler, or should I skip them altogether especially if I don't feel better by tomorrow? 

If this hadn't already happened a couple times over the last few months I'd be way less concerned and more inclined to rest, but I'm nervous I won't be fit enough for the upcoming race.

I am training for my first marathon, CIM in Sacramento on Dec 2. Been doing races for the past 3 years or so. Started officially training (using a 20 week training plan, I think Hal Higdons novice 3). Two weeks ago, literally halfway through my training plan, I hurt something in my lower back/right hip which I noticed after a 9 mile run I was doing that day. I haven't been able to put weight on my right side without pain since then. 

Since then I haven't been running, just some yoga and low-impact workout videos on YouTube. I've seen a chiropractor, gradually got better over those 2 weeks. Finally yesterday I woke up and didn't have to limp anymore; pain was practically gone. Went for a slow run today (barely made it 5 min) and I noticed the pain returning, so I turned around and walked home.

What do I do? Before injury, I was only at about 20-25 miles per week. Was supposed to spend October/early November ramping up the mileage but now I'm worried I won't be ready in time. ",Injury in the middle of training. Can I still do it?

firstmarathon,"Hi everyone, I've decided to start training for a marathon in April. This will be my first time, with very little experience.

I'm an early 20s male, just shy of 190 cm (\~6'3) and somewhere in the ballpark of 83 kg (\~180 lb). I've got a small amount of experience with distance running from competing in cross country back in school, and regularly play soccer so my stamina isn't *terrible* but nowhere near where it should be for this kind of undertaking. 

My best 5k time is 23 minutes but that was a few years ago when I was in much better shape, I could probably manage 25 now at a stretch, maybe approaching 30 on a bad day. 10 k is probably closer to an hour these days. I've been having problems with my knees from a growth related which I've only quite recently started to get over, and can run a few miles without pain, but usually they start to freeze up towards the end of a 10k.

&amp;#x200B;

I've decided to do this marathon, but I have no clue where I should be starting from. I usually run a 5 or a 10k once a week but that's almost exclusively on a treadmill at a gym.

Any ideas of any training regimes I could look into? 

What kind of equipment should I consider buying?

Is 7 months a realistic time frame for this or should I try being a little less ambitious?

* I'll probably be doing grad school interviews in the fall, which will involve a good deal of travelling/stress. Should I start the plan a little earlier in anticipation that I might miss a few days, or should I just miss those days and move on with the plan?
* Not sure how realistic my pace goal is - I'm hoping to run it under 4 hours (and I know for a first marathon the most important thing is just to finish). Just ran a half-marathon distance at 8'30"" pace, so I'm hoping that puts me on track to do a 4 hour marathon?
* I've never really hydrated or anything, even on my long runs (up to 13 miles so far), but I'm anticipating that over 26 miles I'll need to drink more. Should I start trying things out over shorter distances too? I've also read that if you get your body used to hydration, then it starts to need it more/you're forced to do it.

firstmarathon,"Hey guys! As the title says, I'm running my first marathon over memorial day weekend and have been dealing with some knee pain the last few weeks. It all started 3 weeks back after I did a 21 mile run. The run itself felt great but after my body had cooled down I started to get IT band issues in my left knee, and patellar pain in my right. I took the next week off and only ran 3 miles the following weekend and still had some pain in both knees. I've been taking it as easy as I dare to not mess up my training, but also not screw up my knees more.

I ran 15 this past weekend and could feel my knees flare up a little bit, but was able to push through. It wasn't until after my run that they started to really hurt, and my IT band felt like I'd broken my leg.

What do I do? I've done a few half's in the past, and lifting is generally my main fitness activity and have decently strong legs so I don't think it's due to weak quads, and if it is, it's too late to fix now. I've resolved that if I can push through the marathon, I can deal with the pain that will come later. Is this a horrible idea? Am I risking permanent damage? Is there anything I can do now other than stretching and foam rolling? Am I better off sticking with shorter runs or should I try and get one or two 20+ milers in there? As I stated earlier, my furthest run was 21 miles but that was almost 3 weeks ago now. I haven't been training these past 4 months for nothing, and am determined to run it, I just want my first marathon to not totally suck.","One month out, but dealing with knee pain"

I've been running for two years now average 30 miles/week. I've completed 4 half marathons including one last weekend. I am planning to increase my long run this week to 15 miles.

firstmarathon,"Hi all,

I'm considering running a full marathon later this year. No earlier than September, most likely in Oct/Nov. 

I've read through various marathon training plans online. They require a lot of time commitment, which makes absolute sense. 

For a host of reasons, it might be difficult to meet those commitments. Wanted to get your advice on whether my running plan would be adequate preparation for a marathon.  

Here's my typical weekly schedule:

- Run 2x/week on treadmill for about 3.8 miles at around 8:00 min/mile
- Run longer on the weekend outside, typically 5-6 miles at around 9:30 - 10:00 min/mile
- Recently I have increased the weekend run distance. Two weekends ago I did 8 miles, and last weekend I ran a half marathon distance on my own. Both were at around 10:00 min/mile.
- Note: I have done two half marathon races, one in Sept 2017 (around 2h10m) and one a few years before.

If I were to continue this pattern, and increase my weekend runs to mimic something like a Hal Higdon intermediate plan, do you think this would be adequate preparation?

Would like to complete in under 5 hours if possible, but time isn't that important.  

Appreciate any advice/thoughts. Thanks!",Advice on first marathon plan

Resting Energy Burn from Apple Watch: 2000-2100 average

Food: About 2500-2800 intake everyday (I will go past 3200-3500 calories if I do a serious 1500+ calorie run for example)

Big fan of sneaker tech, decided to run in Nike Syleux shoes since I never jog on pavement. 



Sorry for such a late post- I had meant to post yesterday but I ended up passing out writing this up the first time haha

Day 1- posted on reddit, thinking this would be easier
Day 2- lots of people saying don’t do it; I know my body, I know I can do it- just a matter of how long
Day 3- Buy all the equipment and guu for the run, 
Day 4- panic, what should I do? Decide to test mile, timed at 8:35 for a mile, not bad considering it’s been years since track
Day 5- do nothing, eat pasta, watch squid billies, say my final goodbyes.
Marathon day- up at 3:00am couldn’t sleep, find parking at 5:00am, wait until 6:30 to get to race area

Mile 1 
This was the real warm up, was keeping up with my brother and we had a solid run going. It took forever to get out of the corral. The energy and excitement was so much and almost to the point of overwhelming- I’ve never been so self aware and excited all at once. 

Mile 2-3 
My partner for the run starts running off ahead, I can barely see him and visibly he’s pulling off ahead without me. My feet start to numb up, it’s a surreal feeling of stepping down and not feeling my feet but all the impact on my shins

Mile 4-10 
I’m by myself, I slow down my jog and start to get lost in my head. My pace is just fast enough now to make the checkpoints before they close for the shuttle. The absolute fear of not finishing starts to set in. Considering I was never particularly good at running, but could hike forever, my pace becomes set for the run. My miles start hitting at anywhere from 12-15 minutes. I fall behind a significant number of people.

Mile 11-15
I’m noticing the effects of stiffness in my calves and the tenderness of my ankles. I’m pushing through. I start listening to my music to lighten the mood up. Each step feels like it could be my last, especially if I stop to rest. I keep trucking it. 
By the end of my mile 13 my brother messages me he’s done. 

Mile 16-20
Finally came up to the halfway point, the pain in my legs is numb, I just focus on the music and get a couple of messages from my brother. He’s impatient and wonders where I’m at. I got tunnel visioned and stopped keeping track of the mile markers, considering the course pulled a u-turn and sent us back the way we came. 
My mental state is suffering but my body is a constant rhythm of stepping, almost autonomously. I start to notice a guy I pass keeps sprinting off ahead of me then falling behind, probably a bad idea to yo-yo like that.

Mile 20-24
I can see down the street the areas they’ve opened up to traffic. It’s as if a reaper of the shuttle bus is hovering over my shoulder. I’m in the back asides from a few older couples and a few singles. We’re back in the bustle where the crowd is and there’s lot of people walking about with their medals, I feel stuck trying to punch out this hour of the marathon 

Mile 25-Finish
My brother finally sees me, he’s waiting towards the end. He tries to coax to jog the bend and come across the finish line. I can’t. I just keep my pace and he runs off to the end where the gated area for the finish line is. It seems like the people left are families from earlier enjoying food or the other people waiting for the individuals shuttled. There was never too many people behind me, but it seemed like there was less the more I went on, 

My time for my first was 6:39:07, 

I finally finish, and realize I parked my car 3 blocks away at a farm fresh and I have to drive home. I keep my pace as I cross the finish and grab my medal. I keep the solid walk to the car and manage to get home after an hour of traffic.

This was a learning experience, it definitely puts into perspective where I’m at in terms of my health and my mental strength. Failure was never an option for me, but the work involved was absolutely real.

I didn’t manage to hurt myself out there but my legs are puffy and my ankles have seen better days.

I've ran track for three years, and cross country for 2. I have no idea what I what I can do in a marathon, but I set a goal of 3:30

I'll be under the training of my cross country coach who has done multiple marathons before. I don't know his PR but I know he ran like a 2:54 at Chicago a few years ago. He ran for an Ivy League school; he knows his shit.

In cross country I did a 3 mile at 17:44, but my typical races were more in the 18:20 range. 

In track I have pretty consistently run 2:15 for the 800 and 58 for the 400

This puts me at the very bottom of varsity, or the top of JV depending on the day.

Is a 3:30 marathon goal too lofty? I know I can run about 8 minutes pace for a while, and during cross country I did a 12 mile day at 7:40 pace average.

firstmarathon,"Hello, I am 30 years old, 5’8 190lbs and recently came out of running retirement. I’m currently finishing week 4 of the Hal Higdon Novice 1 program and am registered for the Los Angeles Marathon in Mid March. Up until now I have only run 7 miles in this training program and have never ran further than 13 miles in my life. My question is on pacing: I’m trying to figure out what my goal pace should be - I’m currently running an average of 7:30/mile pace on my longer runs (which are still single digits) but am pushing myself. I’d love to run my first marathon at as fast of a pace as I’m realistically capable of, but don’t want to bonk out and fail completely.  

So far I’ve been running all my mileage without much of a pace other than as fast as I can based the terrain, mileage and how I feel - which is fine, but what about an 80 minute run or the actual 4 hour ordeal?

My Garmin watch said my Vo2 Max is 55 and I’m definitely still a good 10-15 lbs overweight so my hope is that as I slim down the pace I’m running at, it will become easier to maintain my current pace on the really long distances but I certainly don’t want to get hurt or be overly ambitious and set myself up for failure.

firstmarathon,"Short background before I get to the point: I've been running for one and a half year now and have completed a 16k and 20k race earlier this year. Both races went quite well, so I decided to start training for a marathon in October. I still need to decide which one since there are quite a few marathons in Belgium and the Netherlands in October.

Today I experienced first hand that a marathon training is something entirely different compared to a 16k or 20k training... :-) During my 20k race training I never ran more than 18k distances. So aside from a few 18k runs and a 20k race, I never ran further than these distances. 
About 10 weeks ago I started following the Hal Higdon Novice 1 plan increasing mileage steadily and today I ran 24k for the first time. I ran it slowly (fat burn heart rate zone) and everything went smoothly until 17k into the run. That's when my muscles and joints started to tighten up. I felt every muscle in my legs, my ankles started to hurt... it just didn't go smooth anymore and it felt as if I was going into 'shuffle' mode instead of running :-). 
I finished the run but the remaining remaining 7k were the longest 7k of my running life. And in order to complete a marathon, I would still need to add 18k to this distance!

Does everyone gets to this point where muscles, joints or legs tighten up during long distance training or race? What do you do to overcome this? Will it ever stop if you keep  training long enough? I hope that by continuing training I'll be able to have a comfortable run for longer than 17k. I do realise that in a marathon at some point you'll just have 'suck it up' and keep on running though :-). What are your experiences? ",How to deal with muscles/joints/legs tightening up?

Starting training for my first marathon in January, and I feel very confident in the exercise aspect of my training plan. I'm feeling less confident about what to do with my nutrition to maximize progress, support my muscles with all that stress and adaptation, but still either maintain or (ideally) lose about 10 pounds.

At this point, the plan is carb cycling, with more carbs leading up to runs, and doing low carb on non-running days, probably 10-20% daily intake. I figured about 1g protein per lb body weight, then fill the rest in with healthy fats? I've tried keto, and not a fan.

When I stop running my lower calves are always very red with a defined line separating the redness of the lower 1/3 with the normal skintone of the upper 2/3's.

I stretch before every run, with special attention placed on stretching my calves, and this seems to help a bit, although the problem still persists. Any thoughts on what it might be? A few factors I can think of that might be contributing to this are my running gate, I don't have much 'bounce' to my gait, my running shoes, I have been using the same ones since January, or my diet, I eat mostly vegan and haven't really changed my diet or portions since starting training.

In getting revenge on the marathon, I have decided to keep 2017 a bit tame and starting back up slowly (also using my husband training for his first couple of halves as a fun excuse :]) and go back full swing in 2018. It took a lot of soul searching but I am so happy to have finally chosen a race.

I started my half marathon career with my hometown race, the Flying Pig and loved it. At mile 11 an older gentleman caught up with me and told me that I was beating half the half marathon pack (he was right, BTW) and that I would be running marathons before I knew it.

Chicago was a serious lesson for me, but I'm going back to my roots for what I'm calling my first ""real"" full that I'll actually (*hopefully*) finish this time.

firstmarathon,"Hey all,

Just wanted to share my experience completing my first 26.2, and the long, strange, often hare-brained road I took to running it.

By way of background, I'm an avid runner but have always struggled with structure. I also have an atrocious diet, smoke  a 1/3 pack a day, and drink fairly heavily. So suffice to say I knew getting in shape would be an uphill battle. My hope that perhaps training for the run would be the cold dose of water necessary to get me to stop treating my body like a rubbish bin. 

I ended up using Hanson's novice plan, which was certainly a cold dose of water, indeed. I was drawn to it because of it's emphasis on mileage spread out over the week and not over-relying on weekend long runs. However, it turns out that those miles taken off long runs do in fact have to go somewhere, and they usually wound up being run at the arse crack of dawn or after long days at work. By the 12th week I was struggling to keep up with the high mileage and had to admit that what I was actually running was a bastardized, neutered version of what seems like a very smart, challenging plan. My weekly kms were pinwheeling wildly, and I was certainly not adhering the basic tenet of the plan, which was to spread them out (relatively) evenly; instead I was constantly trying to ""make up"" for missed runs by piling on additional distance. My longest run would up being around 26km, about three weeks before the race. 

Also, I basically pretended speed work didn't exist. Why? Who knows. Lazy, fear of the unfamiliar, intimidated by the cool kids in running cleats at the local track. 

The actual day of the race was not initially any more heartening. Cool at about 10 degrees above with drizzling rain, and I was feeling tired, bloated from dinner the night prior, and sorely craving a cigarette. Spend the first chunk of race really trying to hold back, find my rhythm and check out the scenic winsome charm of the Peg. But somehow I managed to get confused and by the time I reached the halfway mark, I had gotten it into my head that I was much deeper in the race than I was, and had been really opening up to my race pace.

Rather than dial it back I tried to push on through, and by 30kms I was starting to wilt. By 35km, real pain. My hips and calves were starting to tense up mightily, and I felt as though I had slowed to a crawl. Even what mild inclines Manitoba had to offer would send my thighs into spasms.  I was guzzling gatorade from the water stations, but had never before seen the particular ""squeeze and gulp"" technique required for drinking while running, and instead kept trying to sip it like sherry and splashed it all over myself.
I stayed feeling desperate right up until the end, even the cheers of ""last mile! Almost there!"" didn't lift my spirits, I honestly thought one more mile might be one too many.

Wound up being pleasantly surprised, as I finished at 3:23:30, so I guess I couldn't have boffed it too hard, but it leaves me wondering what I did wrong and where to go from here.

Regardless, I'd recommend the race, tons of fun and charm, good flat and fast course, and if you run it and smoke a cigarette after it will feel like the best coffin nail you've ever had in your life.

I've done several 70.3 triathlons and a few half marathons. Last summer after two 70.3's within 3 weeks I decided to focus on only running for a half marathon in september. I made my own plan, basically subbing a bike workout for an extra run, and failed miserably.

I'm training for my first marathon. I had 2 rock-solid scheduled months of training where I didn't skip a beat.

2 weeks ago was a taper down week to a half marathon which I ran but my IT band really started progressively hurting the last several miles. 

To rest the band (and because I was on vacation) I only ran 5 times the past 2 weeks since the half: 1.38 miles (on beach); 7.26 miles, 4.03 miles; 4.25 miles; 3.02 miles. I did ride my bike around casually a bit during that time though.  

I have to get back on schedule these next 4 weeks before the marathon on 7.23. My plan is to do 18 miles this weekend, 20 next weekend, 12 the following weekend, and 8 the last weekend of training.

I'll be attempting my first full marathon in September and had a training question. I want to follow Hal Higdons Novice 2 program but am a bit confused about how religiously I should stick to the miles recommended. Ive been averaging one long run 13-17miles each week for the past 4 months. 

At the moment I feel like I could run more than what is expected on the long runs on the training program.. I was personally wanting to do a few more runs closer to the marathon distance than the plan (I think it has 2 runs around 20miles in the program whereas I was wanting to do 4 or 5 to really test myself at those distances) but im not sure if that is sensible. Admittedly I havent done anywhere near enough mid week short runs and am about to kick that off.

Should I just trust the program and stick with it, even if it means dropping my mileage for the next 6 weeks or should I build up to the sort of miles that the program expects in the final weeks early and maintain that for longer?

I'm already planning on running a HM on 10/22 this year. I'm trying to decide between a [18-Week](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51137/Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program) or [30-Week](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51143/Marathon-Novice-Supreme-Training-Program) program.


I also need to figure out if I want to do the Marathon in the spring (May 6) or the Fall (October 22). Here is when my training might start:

18-Week Spring: January 1st

30-Week Spring: October 9th$

18-Week Fall: June 18th

30-Week Fall: March 26th

*$If I do this one, I'll actually start a few weeks later, since I'm doing that Half on Oct. 22.*


If I decide to do the Marathon in the fall, I could do a HM instead in May. I would have to start training February 18th, and May 6th - June 18th would be recovering / doing some other running to add to the 18 Week program. 


Sorry I'm all over the place. I guess my real question is, what do you think is best for me? I have no time goal, I just want to finish it. It might be the only Marathon I ever run, but I could see myself doing a bunch more HMs.


So, based on the timing of the races and the resulting timing of training, and the fact that I live in a cold weather climate, should I do it in the fall or the spring? Is it better to run a marathon in a tank top / t-shirt and shorts? Or likely long sleeves / maybe even pants?

",Training for my first 1/2 marathon trail run. Got a simple question
firstmarathon,"Background:
I'm a 24 year old male. Never been a runner, was bored of lifting at the gym and wanted to try something new. My running experience was limited to running a mile after each workout 3x a week for around 2 months before started training. 


Training:
At 5'11 @ 215lbs I started Higdon's Novice 1 program to train for a marathon. Here are my runs in miles averaging 10 min/mile
 
Week 1: Tuesday: 3      Wed: 3       Thurs: 3      Sat: 6

Week 2: Tuesday: 3      Wed: 3       Thurs: 3      Sat: 7

Week 3: Tuesday: 3      Wed: 2       



Injury: After the first long 6 mile run the sides of my knees started to bug me but I didn't make much of it. Then the run before my second long distance the 7 miles I was running with pain already. The first mile of the 7 mile run was painful but after that I got used to running with the pain. The two last runs after my 7 mile run were really painful and made me stop running.


Shoes: I was running mostly using a pair of nike flyknit racers that were really tight on my feet and made me shift my weight to the inside of my foot. Since then I bought a pair of asics running shoes but this was when I was already running with IT Bands pain. I also started using IT Band straps to run and foam roll but once again I was already injured at this point. 


After some research I found out the problem I was having was IT Bands. The side of my knees would hurt even when going up the stairs and walking around chills. I bought some therabands and started the IT Rehab Routine. Since then I have taken 2 weeks completely of running. I am feeling no pain when going up and down the stairs but the i feel slight pain when I keep my legs bent hours and I move them. 


I am bummed because after being bored of lifting for over a year I finally found an exercise that I looked forward to every day and now I am injured and don't know what to do.. My current plan is to keep doing the IT Rehab Routine once a day while going back to the gym to work my upper body until I am ready to run again..


How should I approach this?
What did I do wrong? Did I try to progress too fast?
How much longer should I wait until training again?
I'm I too heavy to be running? Should I drop lbs before running?
Was this caused because of my shitty shoes and lack of foam rolling?


TLDR; Got injured after following a training plan, don't know what caused it and don't know what to do next.","Injured after week 3, what to do next?"

My very first half-marathon is scheduled for May 21st (3 weeks), I was originally training for 8 min/mile pace. The last 4 weeks have been pretty spotty with my running due to numerous tweaks (groin, left hip, right hip, pain in foot - not stress fracture). I have missed a 9 mile and 10 mile run. 2 weeks ago I was able to run a 10k at 7:55 and then my foot pain started.

I struggle to even run 3-4 miles now because of pain. It might have to do with moving my runs from an indoor track to outside. My ankles are in pain by 2 miles. I usually take 2 days to recover when that happens (which is every  time now for some reason..), but I'm finding myself having to recover for 2 days after every single run and its impeding my progress.


Is progress in running just slow? Feet muscles must develop very slowly. I refuse to believe that the pain is a result of my form (because we're born to run! aha). Its not lasting pain - only when I run past the ~2 mile mark. I researched programs and many of them add 1 mile every week and I did that at the start, but I can no longer do it anymore.

firstmarathon,"**TL;DR: marathon in 27 weeks, half in 18 weeks, 10k in 4 weeks. If I go flat out on the 10k should that give me reasonable estimate for calcuating the pace of the marathon?**

Hello! I signed up for my first marathon 27 weeks from now, and I'm trying to figure out a goal pace. 

I've run on and off since 2012, generally running for 3-6 months, getting injured, taking a break for several months, restarting the cycle, never been particularly speedy. Looking back through logs I'm fairly sure my problem was failing to run my longer runs at an easy enough enough pace, and trying to get faster too aggressively without the necessary distance and time to support it. 

I'm trying to break the cycle at the moment by building up a base of a lot of slooooooooow running (about 70-80% of my distance in zone 2 or lower), starting at 15km/week in February, and at least 30km/week for the past three weeks, split over 4-5 sessions. My long slow run today was 12km, and I felt like I could have carried on a bit longer, so I think my calculated zones aren't too far off. 

My general plan is to keep slowly building my total distance (about 10%/week increase for two weeks, then a lighter week for recovery every third) with 5 sessions a week, one being some sort of quality run, three being easy, and the last being long and slow, until 18 weeks out from the marathon. At which point I'll either go for Hal Higdon's novice 2 or intermediate 1 depending on how I'm handling the weekly distance.

I've entered a 10k race in 4 weeks time and scheduled a mini-taper for that - as I'm not doing much fast running at the moment I don't think it'd be as fast as if I focused on more quality runs for the next couple of weeks, but I'd rather keep prioritising building a base at the moment, so that I'm up to ~45km/week by the time I start a marathon training plan properly. 

How accurate an estimate would my 10k result give me for an estimated marathon pace to work towards? My priority is getting round, but having a realistic time to work towards would be great too.

| C | &lt; 4:30 | *Yes* |


### Training
I followed Higdon's Novice 2 plan. I only missed one day -- I was pretty happy about that, but did most of my runs on the treadmill (so boring!). Novice 2 was ok, but I probably should have followed something with more miles per week. Oh well, it worked for my first marathon.

### Pre-race
My idea of carb loading was eating a Z-man (brisket sandwich) -- maybe not the best idea, but I took some fiber the night before, cleaned out my system in the morning, and was ready to go. I kept on checking the weather all week, which was suggesting rain, 15 mph winds, and 40 degree weather. I was pretty bummed out, but then pleasantly surprised to wake up this morning to see no forecasted rain, 50 degrees, and only minor (5 mph) winds. Great running weather!

### Race
Due to parking issues, the race was delayed twice. This was a bit frustrating, but only set the race back 25 minutes. The half and full marathoners ran the first 12.5 miles together, meaning it was decently congested through the first half. 

I joined the 4:00 pace group and had a fantastic time for the first 18 miles or so. The first 10 miles were incredibly easy, I questioned whether I really should had joined the 3:45 pace group. The first 13 miles were through residential space, and then we ran out and back along a paved trail. The trail itself was gorgeous. I joked to a runner around mile 15 that I felt bad for the half marathoners, that they missed out on this scenery. Knowing the world of pain we were in for, he said he did not feel sorry at all for the halfers...

I kept with my pacer through around mile 18, but then started slowing down a bit. My quads were on fire, and the last 7 miles were on an increase, making my legs hurt even more. I had a hard time with the hills and had to walk on every major incline. Around mile 22, I came to grips that I would not beat 4:00, or perhaps even 4:15, but that's ok. This was my first marathon and I was doing it! No one could take this from me, as long as I kept one foot in front of the other. I ended up feeling tingly around mile 24 or 25, but kept on going. I ended up crossing the finish line just under 4:22, and then the real fun began...

### Post-race
I almost passed out afterwards, kind of scary. I signed up for a post-race massage, and the therapist brought over someone from first aid. They gave me water and cleared me, but I still wasn't doing great. (To be honest, I wasn't completely honest in my responses, I just wanted to go home and go to bed, but I think they saw right through me, ha). I don't feel sore now, but I do feel sick (still have fever, chills, despite taking a long shower and bundling up). I'm a bit beat up, but not completely beat down. I'll get you next time, 4:00 PR.

firstmarathon,"##Introduction

Hello all, this is my first time and post on this subreddit. I literally just heard of this place from a very cool guy /u/goose0621.

So I wanted to give my introduction and share my short story about my upcoming first marathon. 

• • •

##The Marathon

The marathon is California International Marathon (CIM) in Sacramento, CA. This and next year it will be hosting the U.S. National Marathon Championships, so I will be within 100yards of the country's - perhaps even world's - fastest runners. 

I've watched this marathon from the sidelines every year for the past 4 years. And for the past 3 years I've told myself, ""Next year I will run it."" To finally make that promise a reality, I impulsively signed up with my friend a few weeks ago. It's happening. 

• • •

##My Running History, Times, &amp; Training

I've been back into running for 2.5 years now. I ran a little in high school (just enough to barely hit 19:30 in the 5K wearing basketball shorts and skater shoes). I returned and decided I was going to supremely crush all of my expectations. I decided I would become the fastest runner I could possibly be. 

I've been averaging 40-55 miles per week the past few months. I have about 7.5 months until the marathon, and I'm already building up on weekly mileage and weekly long runs.

I don't yet have an exact time I want to strive for. My friends and running mentors say I have the potential for 2:50, but I think I'll aim for 3:05 - sub-3 if I'm really prepared. **I think my #1 goal will be to relax and enjoy the experience of my first marathon, not stressing too much about finish times.** 

• • • 

##A Side-Note About Race-Performance-Stress

I've stressed way too much about race times in the past. It sapped a lot of the joy of running because I was never meeting my expectations. Now my belief is, if I'm running faster than I did 1 year ago, then I'm happy. 

• • • 

##Training Goals From Here To Then

My goals are to increase my mileage to at least 70 per week by September and keep it there until mid-November where I'll 'taper down' as they say. And I'm going to do a lot of road races from now until then, with about 3-5 road races planned within the next 6 weeks including my first Half Marathon (goal time: 1:25).

• • • 

##Bye, Bye!

So, that's all I have to say for now. I just wanted to make my introduction. Not sure if I'll provide many updates before the Big Day, but I'll definitely make it a point to come back here and let you all know how I did!

At the moment I'm doing a short run midweek (8-10 miles) and a long run (most recent was 18 miles in ~2:45) on the weekend.


My question is... Is there anything wrong with this training strategy? The marathon is several months away. Is there such a thing as reaching (and trying to maintain) marathon condition too early?

Regarding the treadmill, is there anything terribly wrong with this? I know I won't be used to hills (I'll throw in some actually outside running as the time for the actual marathon nears) but am I missing anything huge? I set up a fan in front it me to keep myself cool but I'd think that would be more than enough to simulate drag forces (as insignificant as that is) and everything else SHOULD be the same... Or am I wrong?


Bonus Question: Does anyone have any mid-run favorite snacks/gels? Some triathletes once told me they like Snickers bars for their Ironmans... At the moment I don't really consume anything mid-run. Just kinda hit it and then chug some water afterward.

The OT workout also typically includes strength work and rowing.

On Monday's I'll plan on running an additional 4 miles at 10k pace (7 (fast) miles total on Mondays). Please let me know your thoughts - Too aggressive? Not enough miles? I'm very interested in the feedback of this group.

After running 7 miles on Saturday (a lot of uphill stuff, only a week into new shoes after over-wearing out other ones...I know, I know; all bad stuff), what I assume to be the IT band on my left outer knee got really bad. I was walking with a limp and really struggled up the steps. It was painful the rest of the day and definitely was aggravated with any up/down hill walking or steps. On flat ground, it subsided and felt better loosening up.

The next day it hurt when I woke up but after stretching and foam rolling, it felt fine the rest of the day.

Obviously, I'm not getting drunk again before the marathon and I'm pissed at myself for having done so. But I was reading that tailbone injuries are slow to recover and it'll take around 4 weeks.

firstmarathon,"Hi all,

Looking for some realistic advice about signing up for a marathon on Aug 20 and a half on June 18th. 

I used to run about one -two 5 km runs every week on and off for multiple years (less then ideal) and took a few months off recently (since Nov). The 5km runs all had about 70m elevation  

I have a 10km fun run tomorrow, and too train for it I ran 10km last Saturday (56:50)- didn't feel great, but did another 10km on Tuesday - felt really good despite a time of only  53:30. I say I felt good as I was able to nearly sprint the last kilometer when I realized my slow time, and in general, just felt like I had lots of energy despite running slower than I had thought.  Both of these 10km runs had elevation gains of 52m

I think I could get under 50 min/10km no problem. 

With this less then ideal level of fitness, do you think I could sign up for a Marathon on Aug 20th? 19 weeks away? I always thought I had a decent baseline running fitness level until I was reading beginner training schedules that all state a base level of fitness higher then what I am currently running (i.e.  5 miles, 3 times a week for multiple weeks).

I would like to finish without walking, but not concerned about time.

Thoughts? Any recommendations of training guides for me? 

Edit: Ran the 10km race today in 47:00 flat, but while I feel good now, I doubt I could of ran it much faster than that. I was pushing hard at the end and was lucky enough to have someone in front of me running a good pace that I used to keep my pace up.

firstmarathon,"Hi guys, this is a cross-post with a question on the Official Q/A thread on /r/running. I'm a 35/M 25-35 mpw from Boston. I've been training for 5k and 10k run biathlons since February 2016, had a hip injury in October 2016 that kept me in rehab/run-walk training until this February, have been running continuously for about 6 weeks relatively painlessly. I had a 2:02 half in September of last year and this weekend just ran a PB 48'20"" on a 10k. I'm in the middle of training for a run biathlon (5k distance) in June. After that I think I want to start training for a marathon.

I've got 3 separate marathon schedules planned out:  

* Jack Daniels' 2Q at 40 mpw starting after a rest week in June and running the Cape Cod Marathon in October. Figure the buildup of 80-&gt;90-&gt;100% mileage (32 -&gt; 36 -&gt; 40mpw) miiiight be OK but even just 18 weeks of training and tacking on 8 mpw without a base building period maybe has more injury risk than I want   

* Doing Pete Pfitizinger's base building from 32-&gt;45 mpw for 7 weeks, switching over to his 38 -&gt; 60 base building for 10 weeks (at 45 mpw but adding weeks to it so that I'm not packing on miles too fast), then doing the Daniels 2Q plan at 60 mpw for the Ocean's Run marathon in March. I've never run anything like 60 mpw and I'm concerned both about the space in my life for the mileage and injury risk at that mileage, but it does give me 36 weeks of training for the marathon and I think I'd be able to get a nice time if I didn't get beaten to a pulp by the mileage and intensity  

* Doing the Pfitzinger base building from 32-&gt;45 mpw for 7 weeks, holding steady at 45mpw for 11 weeks, then doing the JD 2Q plan at 45mpw for running the Ocean's Run marathon. This seems like the most conservative approach and gives me 36 total weeks of training, plus I hear JD's plans are not to be underestimated in terms of intensity.

I appreciate your comments on any of the above, but since I think I'm likeliest to be choosing between the latter two schedules, between being at 45mpw for 28 weeks or various high fractions of 60mpw for 19 weeks: are there any good articles or resources on how runners choose how much mileage they want to build to?

firstmarathon,"My first marathon is this Sunday and I'm not sure what time to aim for. I was initially aiming for 4'30, but there is also a pacesetter for 4'15 and I am tempted to try and go at that pace - looking for advice either way.

I'm a 30 year old man, trained for about 10 weeks, peaking at 32.5km (20.2 miles) in 3'30, three weeks before race day, before tapering off. In the preceding weeks, my long runs were 22km in 2'05hrs, and 31km in 3 hours.

More experienced runners have told me that atmosphere, adrenaline, crowd encouragement, etc play a big part and might help me run faster than in training. Also, the above runs weren't going at my peak effort.

But on the other hand, I'm worried about starting too fast and hitting the wall around 20 miles.

I have been running 3-4 times a week for the past 8 or so years, with an average of 20 - 25 miles per week.  I typically run 5 - 6 miles each weekday run, and then between 8 and 10 miles for a long weekend run.  My questions is, what should I be doing now in preparation for a marathon training program that is scheduled to start in early July?

My typical pace is in the 8:15 - 8:30 neck of the wood, with my race pace between 7:45 - 8:00.  Should I keep running my normal routine until I get to that July training start?  I am leaning towards the Hal Higdon Novice 2 program which calls for much shorter weekday runs, with weekly long run builds each week.

Also, I have never really run with pace in mind, however I just purchased a GPS watch so I could learn to be more disciplined towards setting up a strategy that will see me through to the finish line.  I ran 10 slow miles yesterday forcing myself to a 9:25 avg. pace.  It was tougher than I thought it would be to slow down, however when I finished I felt like I had plenty of fuel in the tank to keep going.  Should I employ this style of pacing to my current long distance running even if the actual beginning of training is months away?

Lasly - Once running the marathon, it seems that the strategy is to hold back to a slower pace for the first half or 2/3 and then speed up if you feel is though you have energy to spare.  Is this how most marathoners attack the course?

As this title says I'm running my first marathon in 4 weeks tomorrow. I have felt like preparation up to this stage has been good; been on quite a lot of long runs and felt fine fitness wise.

My ankle problem has become a little chronic - started a few months ago but after quite a bit of rest seemed to have nullified significantly, however over the last week its been feeling quite sore when not running (strangely enough however, when I run it subsides a little).

The pain differs, sometime its a general ache around the ankle area and other times it comes into the inside of my sole and up my  shins a little. Research suggests it could be tendonitus. It has occurred in both feet however my left one is the only one thats caused me issues recently.

Since before I was a teenager I had old man knees, it was the whole deal, they would be painful when bad weather would show up, I couldn’t sit cross legged without feeling pain in the knees. Afterwards whenever I stood up I wouldn’t be able to put any weight on my left knee, the worst knee, so I would get up using mostly my right leg. I was never injured, it was just shitty genetics, pure and simple.

I tried doing normal squats but that didn’t do anything, lunges did nothing, box jumps or anything similar made my knees feel horrible for a couple days after. Years of this went by where my legs grew stronger but my knees didn’t get better, if anything they grew more painful.

Fast forward more, as I learned more about exercise I stopped looking around for a solution and simply contemplated what could possibly be happening. I realized the problem was that while I was trying to get my legs stronger, hoping that would take away the pain I was making the problem worse. I kept doing the same, linear motion with my leg and that there wasn’t a balance in the strength of my legs. 

To solve the imbalance, I did one leg exercise where I would squat sideways. It was that simple. What I did was what I later found out were called [side lunges](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3BRKE0-l7mg). That’s it, I did this at the end of my leg exercises and that’s all that was implemented, a couple of minutes of exercise once a week.

firstmarathon,"Hi all - training for my first full marathon currently.  On my long runs I've been noticing a pretty sharp pain in my right knee that kicks in around at around mile 5 or 6.  Kind of feels like a tugging at the bottom of my knee cap.  I really only feel this while I'm running - no knee pain when I'm just walking around normally.  I've been icing after my runs.  I'm wondering if any of you have had the same experience and any recommendations on how best to deal with this?  I'd like to try to stick to my long run schedule as best as I can (Hal Higdon Novice 2), but if it's a matter of really messing my knee up vs. missing some training I suppose I'd prefer to do the latter!

firstmarathon,"I've got my first marathon in April (St. Louis). I've run the distance before, at the end of an Ironman, but my amazing plan there was ""keep running"". So this is my first 'just marathon'. My question is about pacing.

I've been hearing the common advice of starting out easy, then ramping up the pace--try for negative splits, no one ever fades to a PR, etc :)

So say my target pace is 8:15 for the race. Would the 'start easy' plan then be to take miles 1-3 or 1-4 at an 8:30 pace, then drop to 8:15? If I do that, I won't hit 8:15 for the whole race, right?

So should I be aiming for more like 

1) 8:20 until mile 4, then *below* 8:15, and then try to maintain that knowing I'll slow down? Or

2) 8:30 till mile 4, then 8:15 until another point (13.1? 16? 18?), and then drop below 8:15?

TBH, I'm not as anal as all this sounds :) But I'd like to have my strategy set going in. (If I don't have a strategy, there's no strategy to fall apart at mile 20.)

I am thinking about my goals for the next year, and the crazy idea has gotten in my head to run a marathon.  I'm tentatively aiming for Savannah Rock n' Roll in November, so I've got a good amount of time.  I ran my first half this year and loved every second of it! 

I am probably going to use some variant of a Higdon plan for training - it worked well for my half, and I figure I might as well start with something pretty well known.  

My big question is, do you use different shoes for marathon training than you do for other running? I have some Brooks Ravennas that I adore, but after my half I had some foot pain for the next day or two.  I am wondering if I need a little more cushioning or something if I'm going to ramp up my long runs so much more in the next year, and I should start saving up for shoes if I need different ones :)

firstmarathon,"I am interested in doing my first marathon at the age of 34. It takes places on a relatively flat course on May 21st. My main concern is that the temperature averages 15/22c or 59/71f at that time of year. The gun is at 9am and it will not be well shaded, but probably overcast. My goal is to finish, my secondary goal is to be 4:30 or less. I hear that the optimal temperature for marathons is much, much lower than these expected temps. Is it still OK?

A little background: I run, but just barely consider myself a runner. I was a mediocre XC runner in high school, I was a sprinter in college and then didn't run for ages. In the past 3 years I have been running 3-6 days per week. I have competed in 10k trail runs and have done a half marathon in training, but never an 'official' one. All of my recent training has been pretty technical trail running with tons of elevation gain on the mountain next to my apartment. On the mountain, 10k is relatively easy for me at a moderate pace, and I could handle probably 10m without walking. On flat ground, if my feet and knees were OK with the different terrain, I think I could do more.

Should I still run it if I have some residual pain? Or would it not be a smart decision? ",Should I run marathon in less than 2 weeks with shin splints?
firstmarathon,"Since I lurked on this subreddit regularly during my preparation, I thought I’d share my experiences and impressions of the race, for what it’s worth.

**Running background**: 29 yo male (185 cm, 75 kg). I’ve been running for about six years, but mostly little mileage (one or two 10k runs a week, on average). I ran about seven 20k (PB 1h24, just to give you an idea) or half marathon races before taking up the marathon challenge.

**Marathon training**: I didn’t follow any specific marathon training plan, but I tried to adhere to the general ideas that usually recur in most plans: slowly building up mileage the three to four months up to the race; one long run a week, slowly increasing its distance every week; one speed run, one interval training, two easy recovery runs and two rest days. Monthly mileage up to the 20 November race: Jan-May &lt;100k, June 104k, July 147k, August 172k, September 256k, October 279k. I managed to stay injury-free, taking it easy whenever I had the slightest indication of overcharge.

**Race experience**: I took the first 5k relatively easy, as I had read the primary cause of hitting the wall was going out too fast. Then I ran at race pace (+- 12.8 km/h) to see where it would get me. I ate and drank well (water every 5k; in total 6 energy gels, 1 banana), I ran consistently and I managed to avoid hitting the wall. It got tough from the 35k mark and I slowed down a bit, but I didn’t collapse and the magnificent crowd took me home to the spectacular finish.

**Circuit**: I loved the route of the Valencia marathon! The city is made for running: it’s flat, beautiful and the climate is great. The support was incredible, especially in the latter part of the race. I can’t really compare it to any other marathon since it was my debut, but experienced marathoners also tell me it’s one of the best. Highly recommended to go to Valencia to run the marathon and stay a few extra days to enjoy the city!

**Tips**:

1) Cross-training. I’d personally advise anyone to take up some cross-training in the marathon training plan to avoid injuries. I swapped some tough interval runs for indoor rowing. It helped me to build up stamina while minimizing strain in the joints, muscles and ligaments, since rowing is a low-impact sport. In my experience, rowing is a very efficient way of improving endurance and it strengthens the core muscles, which improves running form.

2) Run plenty of (very) long runs. I think the fundamental part of preparing for a very long race like a marathon is by… running very long distances. It’s a very obvious idea, but because running long distances is tough, I think many people prefer to ignore it. I would personally advise to run three or four 30+ km long runs of which one or two 35k’s. I know many experts would disagree, claiming the risk of injury outweighs the added training reward of 32+k runs, but I feel getting used to the idea of keeping on running when your legs get very heavy after about two hours is absolutely crucial.

firstmarathon,"Hi r/firstmarathon,

I’m starting training for my first marathon this week (Barcelona, March next year) and am planning to use the MyAsics training plan. I used it to train for a half last month and it had me hit my target time bang on (1:44:39 against a target of 1:45). Aiming for sub 4hrs (just) for the full. 

I’ve just created the plan for the full marathon ( [here]( http://imgur.com/a/uDPfh) ) and have a couple of concerns that I would like a more experienced runner to alleviate if possible. 

Firstly – the midweek mileage seems a bit low, particularly once I get into the middle/end of the plan (as a percentage of weekly mileage compared to the long run). Do you agree? 

Secondly – The pace of the long runs. The target pace for the long runs is only 5seconds/km slower than target pace. This seems a bit quick to me and thought that long runs should be comfortable and speed work should be incorporated into the midweek runs. Should I slow down the longer runs? I don’t want to injure myself. 

Thirdly – Long Sunday runs seem to alternate weekends, with a longer run one week then a short comfortable run the following week. Is this preferable to a steady progression of distance each week? 

Thanks for your time.

### Background
Hi r/firstmarathon, thought I'd do my race report while recovering from my first marathon! 23/M/Boston

At the beginning of the year, I decided to try to train for a half marathon. My very first run was 2.53 miles at a 9:03 min/mile pace according to runkeeper, and I remembered it was pretty tough. But training went well for that and midway through i decided to sign up for the Brooklyn Marathon, right before Thanksgiving.

I hit 1:51 for my half, so I was aiming for a sub-4 hour marathon and hooray, I did it!

### Training
Training could have been much better for sure; I basically took summer off so I had to play catch up at the beginning.

I also took the risk of making pretty large jumps in my miles per week; I never had injury issues during my half training and i figured I was young and tough (I also spent February working on my form when i first started). 

I started off in September going at 17-20 miles per week for 3 weeks, then jumped to 30-35 miles per week for 3 weeks. I ran a half in 1:46 as part of a tuneup 2 days after a really rough hill workout so I felt things were going well. 

I then jumped to 40-45 miles per week for 3 weeks, getting two 20 mile runs in. I skipped my first taper long run because I was in NYC watching the marathon, so my taper weeks were 15 miles/25 miles/10 miles.

My training was the usual mix of half marathon paced tempos / intervals, and easy runs. I also did 3 sessions of hill workouts at Boston's November project to train for the hills at the Brooklyn Marathon (get to that later) as well. Besides the one taper run I skipped, I did skip the two easy runs because I didn't want to get out of bed.

### Race strategy
I was very confident I would be able to complete the marathon, so the focus was getting sub-4. That meant a focus on starting slow and avoiding the wall. I also figured I may be able to hit under 3:50 given how I did on my half. 

It also meant being careful with the hills. The Brooklyn Marathon includes 6 loops of Prospect Park, which includes some moderate elevation. The elevation wasn't bad but doing it six times sounded like it could get rough. The hill workouts at November project were much tougher and got me acclimated though.

### Pre-race
The Brooklyn Marathon is a very small marathon (500 people?), so I felt fine waking up at 7 AM, drinking some coffee/eating a cliff bar and then getting down there by 7:45. Jogged over to the start and stayed bundled up because it was pretty windy and chilly.

My friend came down with me to watch and also to help manage some of my gels; the website didn't mention too much about having gels around so I brought my own in case (they ended up having Clif shots).

### Miles [1] to [18]
Everything felt pretty good. Besides holding back miles 1-3, I focused on holding a 8:50-9 min/mile pace and feel. The hill wasn't bad at all and I only slowed down moderately (9:15 min/mile or so) and went loose on the downhills.

I did chow down a lot of gels; I ate 7 in total, mainly because at around mile 15 I was feeling a little hungry/slightly light headed, and had bonked during one of my training runs. Luckily I avoided that. Still, I did my my first half in ~1:54 so under 3:50 seemed in the cards.


### Miles [19] to [22]
Feet are starting to hurt here, but not enough to hit my pace. Mile 20 was the first time the hill hit me though and forced me to slow down more

### Mile [23]
Left quad cramped AND I had the hill to fight through. Sucked a lot; I decided to try to run through it although it was excruciating, but I was still getting a decent pace out.

### Miles [24] to [25]
Managed to recover from the cramp and do better and went past the last downhill pretty strong. Knew that I was probably going to hit sub-4 hours but 3:50 is gone.

### Mile [26+]
Cool, right quad cramped in the last mile. But with only a mile to go, I just focused on pumping my arms hard and forcing my legs across the finish line.

### Post-race
It was freezing and windy and I was in so much pain. I had to lean on my friends to leave and get to the car, and I'm still just lying in bed now. But hey, I started off this year not being able to imagine running a marathon and I just did it far faster than expected. It felt good.

Next? I'm going to work on 5ks/10ks as so far I've only done half marathons and a marathon. Once I build some more speed, i'll start aiming for faster halves and marathons. Obviously my goal is to BQ but with grad programs to apply to, not sure if that's something I'll be able to focus on super hard. But hopefully I'll get to that eventually.

Hope you enjoyed it! Thanks to this sub for providing so many stories; they really helped me refine my training and inspire me to get going.

firstmarathon,"Today was a 16 mile long run in lead up to the Jan 8 marathon at Disney World. I almost called for a ride at 1.5 miles, gave up at my 3.2 mile turn and couldn't wait to get home.

I don't expect perfect conditions down there, but I do expect weather better than I had today.

It was over 60 yesterday. Recent weeks have put my runs at a perfect 55 or so degrees. This morning was too much change, too fast. I wore a coat that created a sauna but my legs and feet were wet and very, very cold. Honestly, I mentally gave up but I really believe I avoided injury by not staying out there.

I'm thinking of spreading my ""lost"" 10 miles over the next few days to maintain the weekly goal. Running in actual winter snow isn't as bad as these rainy transition days.","Gave up this morning due to cold, rainy, sleet, windy weather. Not proud but I don't regret coming home."

I'm not a massively experienced runner, but I'm 24 and in good shape. Been running on and off for 3 years. Can anyone recommend a good training regime and/or some good books on marathons?",Is aiming for under 4hrs over ambitious for my first marathon?
firstmarathon,"Hey everyone

Really started enjoying running (picked it up a few years ago but REALLY loving it now) and lost a ton of weight (240 to 210) training for my first half in April, then got to my current fitness state to run my second half in October at 2:11, which felt good.

Well the traverse city marathon in 2017 is on my 30th birthday, so I'm gonna do it. I need to take the next steps on my diet, so far it's been the ""low hanging fruit"" pun intended: sure get a double cheese burger but no fries, yeah get drunk but stick to vodka soda, I'm gonna eat pizza but it'll be a thin crust I make at home. My doctor has cleared me to train, but I'm just a little nervous to run a full marathon at my weight so I would love to drop 15 to 20 pounds before race day. I'm not doing this to loose weight, but I know I need to loose more weight to get faster obviously. I should note that I only get pains when I over do it on the cross training or run too fast on a slow day, so my weight is really only holding back my pace and stamina.

Anyway that's not really why I'm here. I have too much time before my marathon and I don't know what to do! Hal Higdon (my program of choice) doesn't start til 18 weeks out and I have way more weekly mileage than the program assumes at the beginning. So right now I'm thinking I just kinda keep training at 25 miles a week and then drop down to the program miles 19 weeks out (need that buffer week just in case) but at a slightly faster pace. This way I can help ensure that I'll finish well under 5 hours. Does this make any sense? Sort of like how weight lifters de load in order to lift more weight in the future?

Anyway, registration opens December 1 and worst case scenario is I show up and run the half instead (nah WCS is my knee explodes on a 20 mile run because I weigh 200 pounds), which will still be a nice 30th birthday.","Third half in 10 days, First marathon 190 days out [M, 205, 5'10""]"

firstmarathon,"I have IT band issues. These longer runs have been hit or miss on whether the knee pain (outer side of knee) surfaces or not. For my 20 miler, I slowed my cruising pace down even more and forced myself to take a walk break every two miles (usual long run pace is around 10 min/mile, generally only take one quick break on runs between 8-12 miles). I've also found that doing squats during the breaks helps delay the IT band issues if I feel it coming on. My 19 mile run was bad, the pain started before mile 10 and the squats only worked to a certain point and I had to walk the last few miles. I did not take walk breaks until later. The 20 miler went better, the pain didn't really start until mile 14, at that point I started run/walking until the end.  Three weeks out from the race, should I expect the last 6 miles to be even slower and try to slow down even more for the race? I was planning on starting with the 4:53 pace group since that's slower than my cruising pace and hope to keep ahead of the 5:08 group.

firstmarathon,"I am a slow 70YO male runner.  I have run two half marathons over the past 18 months , fastest time was 2hours 29 minutes. I used a Jeff Galloway run/walk training plan for both of these - I used a small ratio 30/45 sec run/walk ratio for the longruns, and larger ratios up to 3/1 mins for weekly race pace practices. During both actual races, I abandoned my timer device during the race ( didn't want it to be beeping loudly so often with others close by to me ) and adopted a kind of ""fartlek"" style of running for the race - I would pick something up ahead that would take me about a minute to run to ( maybe say 150-200 metres away) , run to it and then walk for 60 paces.  Rinse and repeat for 21.1 klms.

### Training
My training consisted of following [The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer](https://www.amazon.com/Non-Runners-Marathon-Trainer-David-Whitsett/dp/1570281823). I am a runner, but I was told this book would get me in the right mindset for running a marathon. The goal since the beginning was completion as mentioned in the book and I upped the ante of the training schedule in the book by making my longest run be 22 miles, instead of the published 18, so I can try to prepare for the wall as much as possible. There were times in my training where I had to take an extra couple days of break or skip mid week runs altogether so I wouldn't really damage things like my IT band or hip flexors, which were problem areas at times. I also had to skip an entire week because my real life stuff was occupying too much of my day. I regret this a bit, but it ended up really helping in my recovery. Running in the heat was very important to understand my hydration requirements. I found that gatorade did not work well with me because it made my mouth extremely sticky. I eventually found out about [Skratch electrolyte mix](https://www.amazon.com/Skratch-Labs-Exercise-Hydration-Serving/dp/B00MOP77F0/ref=pd_sim_121_3?_encoding=UTF8&amp;refRID=Y4NSYK1QDAXN30DE8Z2T&amp;th=1) and used that and water on my [hydration belt](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B012ETAZWC/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s01?ie=UTF8&amp;psc=1). The long runs is where I figured out the best nutrition before and during the run. I had to consume food before the long runs, and I did experiment with three conditions: no food, some food, and a lot of food. Here is what I did eventually: 20 minutes - 30 minutes before the run I would eat/consume  2-3 bananas, 2-3 Nutri-grain bars (Apple cinnamon flavor), coconut water, regular water, a sip of gatorade, and a Gu packet or two if it was &gt;16 miles. At about 8 miles, 16 miles, and 22 miles I would have a Gu and drink Skratch and water. Post training runs, especially long runs, would be high-protein, moderate carbs. I was rarely ravenous after a run, and sometimes had to force down food because of an uneasy stomach.

I run with no music as recommended by the book. This is shocking to a lot of people but it is very meditative for me. I ran with a GPS watch, which I generally cross verified with onthegomap or something similar. 


### Pre-race
I left way early, arrived at the parking structure with 40 minutes to spare, ate on the way there, did my pretty typical pre-race nutrition, and got to the race start with about 30 minutes left til the gun went off. I really needed to use the bathroom which was located about 3 minutes jog from the start. The line at the bathroom took 25 minutes to get to the front and I literally had to run towards the start line since the clock was real close to 7AM. I made it to the general pace area I wanted to be in with 30 seconds to spare and didn't have time to do my typical rituals: re-tie my shoes, get my GPS watch ready, do some minor stretches, readjust my hydration belt (which I eventually ran with but I didn't bring it with me when I went to the bathroom and left it with my parents and quite literally bumped into my parents by an absolute miracle with about a minute and half left til the gun went off), and general chit-chat I do with people around me. I even missed the anthem!

### Race
I ran to how my body felt. I knew I would see my parents in the course at certain points, but seeing them was always very rewarding and surprising every time. There were some hiccups with some people on the course, some annoying folks here and there, but overall it was an amazing crowd and a beautiful route. I like to talk with people around me, but nearly everyone had earbuds or headphones on and were peeved when I said a stupid joke. I loved all the signs that were there. A priest was even blessing all the runners which was pretty cool!!! I never hit the wall. I saw at least 6 people hit their own wall, and some even seized up or doubled over and couldn't move a muscle. The reason for this was the course was designed so that miles 22-25 were basically all uphill, which I was okay with because I only had hills to train with near me. Hearing people cheer for me was motivating. Hearing awesome DJs, marching bands, and Star Wars music was so much fun!! It was all brilliant. Loved it! My body signaled that I needed to pee at some point after the half-way mark and lo and behold I REALLY needed to go at mile 25. And I am like ""Really dude? I am so close to the finish!"" When someone told me there was half a mile left, I couldn't believe them because I was on an uphill and couldn't see the finish line. The minute I saw the finish line with about 400 meters left, I did a full on sprint and was regretting sprinting so early, but I just had that eye on the prize of celebrating turning 26.2 years old with this marathon and nothing could stop me. Then after the fact I saw the time on the clock and was pretty blown away. So cool to actually do a marathon!!!

### Post-race
I experienced similar soreness to my 22 miler, but nothing debilitating. My stomach was still fairly uneasy and I didn't go ravenous. I had to force some food in me. It is now about 2 days after the race and I feel about 80% recovered and if I really wanted to, I could go for a run tomorrow. Instead I will take a week or two off and start doing some P90X and maintenance running. I think marathons are my thing! If anyone has any questions, feel free to leave a post down below!! If you PM me, there is a chance someone with a similar question won't see it. #sharingiscaring

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THIS SUBREDDIT!"
firstmarathon,"Just finished my first marathon (NYC) in 3:55:35.

I was severely underprepared- running ~20ish miles per week on a treadmill lol, with my longest being 10 miles. I have been consistently lifting for about 2 years however, and I think it helped a lot. I was surprised at how many people were ""hitting the wall"" on the Queens bridge, and slowing down considerably. I think my strength/stride helped a lot with the hills and bridges.

Because I was so underprepared (and running without headphones which ive NEVER done), I felt terrible after ~11ish miles. But the crowd was AMAZING. Seriously, they gave me the motivation to keep trucking along. I came close to hitting the wall around mile 20, but started playing mind games mile-to-mile, really digging deep with self motivation. I actually had my fastest 4 miles consecutively for the last 4 miles because I was so hyped by the crowd/motivated by the end being near.

Takeways (some obvious, some YMMV)
1. Follow a plan, stick to it. Mileage based plans are there for a reason, don't freeball it like me and suffer.
2. Either train without music, or make sure you dont forget your headphones on race day. I was so lucky that the NYC crowd is amazing to keep my mind occupied.
3. Train with INCLINE, hills etc. Seriously, I can't state this enough. They will come and they will SUCK.
4. Carb loading for a couple days before worked for me, but evidence for this is up in the air as far as i know, so it may have been placebo
5. Practice pacing. I know this is obvious, but all my training runs (treadmill nonetheless) were very imbalanced negative splits. This wont happen race day, learn to pace.

Other than that, I just want to say what an amazing experience! I will definitely train harder (OUTSIDE!) and more frequently and follow an actual plan for my next marathon.

firstmarathon,"Background: I come from a running family; I ran in HS ...took 20 years off, and at age 38 and fat, took it back up, but initially just casually, and even took a break in there. But about 18 months ago, got more serious. Have coached middle school XC the past 2 seasons, and have been doing a 13.1 race every month in 2016. Currently hitting 30+ mpw.

I'm not an expert, but I feel pretty confident in my knowledge base, and the principals of periodization, including base training, speedwork, recovery runs and tapering. I've never followed a training plan, even for my half's, and am inclined to not follow one for what could potentially be my first full in 2017 (leaning towards a fall full, but nothing decided in stone yet).

I have several questions that I am hoping you all can pool your knowledge and help:
1. Deciding between Philly, Newport (RI), and Baltimore. Philly and Baltimore are good times of the year (early Nov and late Oct respectively), whereas Newport is super flat but is in April (ugh winter training, not my thing). Basically I want one that is FLAT and that I don't need to qualify for, and that is within a reasonable distance of Boston where I can make it a long weekend,  and my parents can come. They weirdly love to watch my races!
Any other suggestions?? 

2. Recommended training plans? Gear? General advice that can't be found anywhere else? I am looking to run 3-4 days a week, it's important that I have 1-2 rest days (my knee doctor recommends 2), and time for strength training and/or yoga. 

3. My  half marathon times have been...meh. My first was about 2:30 and most have hovered around there, with my worst being something like 2:55. I'm not super embarrassed or anything - for me, I never thought I would run more than like, 5 miles with my knee surgery, so just crossing the finish line has been a huge accomplishment. Plus I've always been a slow runner. But I'm getting faster, and I'd like to aim for a 10-11 minute mile, I'm fine with that. Is that okay!?

I have been running consistently in preparation for the marathon with 1/2 marathons in May, July, and this this past weekend (October). Otherwise I have also ran 30km two weeks ago. My weekly Km's total have been around 45km on average.

Shall I run one last 'big one'? If so, how far? 
Thanks so much and sorry for being so vague and not really well prepared when it comes to a plan!

",One final 'big run' before the NYC Marathon (Nov 6th)
firstmarathon,"
Four years ago I weighed about 70lbs more than I currently do.  I tried lots of things to get in shape over the years without much success.  I moved to a new city and found an awesome group of people called ""triathletes"".  I joined the local club in January of 2013 with the goal of completing a sprint triathlon in June.  By May that seemed too easy so I reset my goal on an Olympic or Half Ironman by the end of the year.  I registered for a couple of December races in Thailand, completed a race longer than an Olympic and the DNF'd a 70.3 the following weekend.  Too much too soon.  During that year I also ran a half marathon in 2:09.

The following year I got more serious, learned more about training, nutrition, bought a Garmin and hired a coach for a few months.  I trained primarily by heart rate, with lots of long slow distance.  I struggled to recover from my runs, and usually needed at least a day between each run.  I completed two 70.3's that year, with half marathon's of 1:51 and 1:56 (as a part of the half Ironmans)

But I started hating my bike.  I live in the North, and the bike trainer sucks for 7 months per year.  But so does riding outside where I live, same routes, same dangerous traffic, not much scenery, just lots of stress.  I tried forcing my way through my lack of motivation but by summer 2015 I completely lost motivation and caught a big case of fuckarounditus, didn't enter any races and wasn't motivated to train much, maybe four or five hours a week running and swimming.  

In February of this year I started running outside on some nearby trails.  I loved it.  I built up my volume over the winter, spring and summer to the point that I can run every day.  I've had no injuries.

My weekly volume for most of the summer has been between 80-100 km /week almost all of it slow at a HR of 130-135 (my Zone 1), with the exceptions of hills (I try to stay in zone 2 ie fully aerobic) and some short 5 x 30 seconds intervals I do on each run (to keep my stride stretched out at least a little bit). 

I ran a half marathon in September two days after running a 50K training run, and finished in 1:41.  I followed the 1:45 pacer for the first 7km, just hoping to hang on and run under 1:50.  But I realized I could handle running a little faster, so I dropped him and just ran a comfortable Zone 2 pace (HR about 140-142).  I treated it as a training run for my October ultramarathon and really never pushed my effort.  I know I could do 1:39 if I just went out at my pace from the start.  I have no idea what my time would be if I pushed.  I don't know if I can push?

Earlier this month I completed my first ultra, a 100km trail race in about 16 hours (it was mostly fun, the last 4 hours were a little rough).  

What's funny is that the race I can't get out of my mind is the 1:41 half marathon.  It's faster than I ever thought I'd be.  And it's got me thinking I should consider options I never entertained before.  Mostly, Boston.

So my goal for this year is a ""fast"" marathon, specifically I want to Boston qualify.  I'll be 40 soon, so that's a 3:12 (to be safe) .  I'm still probably 25-30 lbs overweight and expect that to keep coming down but maybe not all the way.

So my questions:

* What/who should I read?
* What plan should I follow?
* I like volume and dislike intensity, is there a plan for wimps like me?
* Can I keep running on trails?  What's the minimum amount of road running I can get away with?
* It's already a snowy, icy, slushy mess, so track work will need to be done either on flat trails, an indoor 200M track or the dreadmill, what's my best option?
*  Is it possible to go from an September 1:41 half to a May 3:12 marathon or am I taking crazy pills?
* What other advice would you give me?
",How to train for my first marathon with a slightly unconventional running background (and probably way too much info provided)?
firstmarathon,"I'm in the tail end of Higdon's Intermediate 2, just starting week 16 and the taper. For reasons I won't go into, I was unable to do the final 20 mile long run yesterday, and had planned to do it today. I was barely able to eek out 9 miles. It was just one of those runs, my body would not go any further. 

Aside from this misstep, I've otherwise been perfect with the plan, hitting every run on schedule. I'm not super-concerned about the impact, since I had already done 2 20's earlier, but it does worry me at least a little bit. How concerned should I really be, if at all?",Looking for a tiny bit of reassurance after having a hiccup on the final long run of my plan.
firstmarathon,"After 3 months of training (loosely followed Hal Higdon Intermediate plans), [I finished my first marathon](http://m.imgur.com/yDo4QkI) at the Baltimore Running Festival (official finish time was 3:38:49). It was much worse and much more amazing than I expected. I'm going to try to explain why.

**Worse than expected:**


*1. HILLS. SO MANY HILLS.* It was my fault for being surprised by this because I didn't check the course details until 2 days before the race. I feel really dumb since I've lived here for 3 years, and I know there are hills all around the city. I trained mostly on a really flat waterfront promenade with maybe 2-3 hill sessions on the treadmill. Not even close to prepared. The placing of the hills is especially challenging. A lot of them are between miles 15-21, and there were many times I had false hopes of this being the last hill. It is currently still very difficult for me to walk because my calves are so sore. Also, I had pretty terrible pain in my right toe for the last 5 miles or so. I have never experience that before, and I wouldn't be surprised if it were related to the hills. Lesson learned: check the course to figure out how much hill training you need to do and then do it.

*2. Getting water/fuel while running.* My fault again because I didn't bring my own water or practice fueling on the go. I was not prepared for how crowded and hectic the water stops could be. They slowed me down a lot, and I had to run pretty hard to catch up with my pace group after most of them, which was not fun. Also, I didn't eat any of my energy gummies until mile 8 or 9, and I should have done it way sooner. I had some pretty severe stomach cramps after the race, that  I think were related to this. Next time, I will absolutely have my own water on me and practice fueling while I run. 

*3. Running the last 10 miles with half marathoners.* First, I want to say that I really love half marathons, and my next race will probably be one. BUT it is a little demoralizing to have them racing with you toward the end of the marathon (they start at the marathon half-way point, but the merge point is around mile 16). I was being passed constantly by lots of people that had the energy to kick it towards the end, while I was fighting a battle in my head to keeping going. It made it even worse that the Baltimore Running Festival has ~10,000 half marathoners to ~4,000 marathoners. One good thing is that they give a badge that says ""FULL"" to wear on your back, so lots of the half marathoners would yell supportive things to me while they passed me.

**Better than expected:**


*1. Pace group.* Based on my training runs, I decided to run with the 3:35 pace group. I ended up losing them around mile 18 because I couldn't handle the hills, but they were definitely the reason I kept a good pace up to that point. Lots of chatting, moral support, and heads-up about the course and water stations from the group leaders. The only negative thing was that it was kind of crowded at the beginning. I'm used to running alone, and there were lots of people in my pace group. Even so, I would definitely run with a pace group again, assuming they're all as awesome as the Baltimore Marathon.

*2. Spectators.* There were way more people than I expected cheering us on with high-fives and signs and candy and beer. More so for certain parts of the course, but even in the ""bad parts of town"" there were people on their porches watching and cheering. This was especially crucial for the last 6 miles where I seriously considered quitting at least 20 times.

*3. The course.* Hills aside, I really enjoyed the marathon course. I got to see a lot of the beautiful parts of the city. We even ran through the zoo around mile 4 or 5 where they had a few animals out as ""spectators."" Even though I was not in the best place physically, my favorite part of the course was the flat lap around a huge lake after finally getting past most of the hills.

*4. The finisher's medal.* I mean, [how cool is this?!](http://m.imgur.com/a/fnxX6)

All-in-all, this was an amazing experience. Even though I didn't meet my goal of 3:35 and I can barely walk, I am still floating with happiness. I rememember the exact moment around mile 21 where I realized I wasn't going to make my goal, and I didn't care AT ALL. I will absolutely be running another marathon at some point, but I'll probably wait at least 6 months. One of my favorite moments was when someone yelled ""No more training! Your weekends are yours again!"" Pretty excited for that. At least for a little while!

I am over my sickness, whatever that was, and only ran two days last week, a 7 miler and a 14 miler. The 14 was a disaster. I finished it, but I had to walk the last two miles. For some reason, by mile 9 everything just crashed. I pushed to 12, but had nothing left after that.

I looked at Endomondo and it said that we had started out 2 minutes faster than we usually do. I am sure that was it. It was such a nice morning too and I think we got caught up in not having to run in the heat and humidity. So bad run was bad. It's in the past, moving on!

### Training
I was originally supposed to do this race in 2015 but in late-August/early-September I was diagnosed with a stress fracture on my right leg, on the upper shin (maybe 3 inches below the knee) due to rotating my foot in when I run.. The lovely people at the race company let me defer to 2016 for free, so I could focus on recovery. I had to take off a good chunk of time, but at the end of December I was cleared to start trying to run again--along with a fresh new paid of custom-shoe inserts--literally starting with 30 second run intervals over a 5:00 minute walk.  I built up to a half in early April (somehow PRed in the blizzard that was the Syracuse Half Marathon) and started the training for this race.  As a lot of you know, this summer in NY was hot and HUMID.  Training sucked.  I was literally having to change to a different shirt halfway through running because it had gotten so heavy from sweating.  I tried to focus on nutrition and building up the mileage as much as I could without injuring myself again.  I only ran 4 days a week (MWF and a long weekend run) for a majority of the weeks and peaked at just over 40 mpw.  I had two 20 mile runs, two 18 milers (including the 18.12 race in Watertown at the beginning of September) and overall tried to have a consistent, but manageable training plan.  During this time I had a lot of stress with work and was actually traveling throughout NY state 4 out of the last 5 weeks, including the day before the race.  So yeah, it is what it is. 

During my training I battled hip issues (all due to the issue that caused the stress fracture and my long-standing knee issues) as well as a nagging hamstring twinge.  Nothing like a literal pain in the butt to make running not as fun.

### Pre-race
The one good thing about traveling so much the week(s) before the race is that I didn't get much of a chance to get nervous!  My mom came up Friday and we picked my sister and my 8-month old nephew up from the airport on Saturday.  Packet pickup was super small, but I got a new Garmin vivoactive HR to replace my 110 and fitbit for race day :)  I live an hour from the race but we decided getting a suite at a local hotel would be easier for all involved.

I woke up that morning, drank some coffee, did my toilet business, and had my mom drop me off at the start, which was the minor-league baseball stadium.  It was chilly for the t-shirt I was wearing, but I'm a heavy sweater so I knew I'd be already when we started.  It was actually perfect running weather (50s, cloudy), especially considering the all-day downpour we had the day before. The nerves were starting to pick up but I met up with a few friends and chatted until the anthems. They lined us up and it was time to go!   There were no pacers so it was up to be to be on top of what I needed to do.  I sucked down a gel and crossed the start.

### Miles [0] to [3.5]
One of my friends who was doing the full as well was running with me for this part and trying to chat.  I felt bad, but I'm more of a solo runner and didn't really engage much.  We eventually broke off and I continued on my own.  This part of the race was the same race as the corporate challenge that I've done the past few years and I felt pretty good.  I was smiling, yelling to some friends who were spectating, etc.  I did the first 3 miles at a 9:40/mile pace and I was happy with how I was feeling.

### Miles [3.5] to [6.5]
As I hit the first 5k, I was feeling good but having a little bit of trouble breathing.  I'm not sure if it was allergies, the nerves, or what, but it felt like I was having an anxiety and/or asthma attack.  My pacing was good at this point (9:45/average).  I knew I needed a 10:18/mile pace for 4:30 so I was feeling pretty good.  My bad knee was twinging a little but nothing more than normal.  This part of the race is through Onondaga Lake Park, which is where they do Lights on the Lake.  It was definitely weird seeing Christmas light displays being set up in the beginning of October!  I saw my parents (my dad got up at 5:00 to stand outside and see me run by like, twice over a 4 hour period) at 5.5 miles and perked up a bit.  The plan was to see them again at 11 and 21, but more on that later.  I took another gel around 5.5.  My goal was to take one every hour.

### Miles [6.5] to [11]
Mile 8 is where the half marathon broke off from the marthoners.  The aid station at this point was a group of my people (Team Red, White, and Blue), who are seriously the best motivation ever.  As we moved out of the park onto a road, there was a slight elevation bump, but nothing too bad.  This who section was an out and back on a back road.  Maybe two spectators, water stops ever two miles, etc. so it was a it lonesome, especially now that a majority of the runners had split off (there were only 273 marathoners and 839 halfers).  I was still feeling okay but I wasn't feeling nearly as good as I had at the 18.12 Challenge only a month prior (which I ran at a 9:55/mile pace and included an energy crash at mile 16) which was concerning.  The turnaround point seemed to take forever but when I finally got there, I got a new spurt of energy.  The run back to park felt much faster and I got to see a few of my friends who were also running, as well as cheer on the pack leaders.  We turned back into the park and through the Team RWB water station again.  Two of my friends had cookies and shots to hand out, but it was a little early in the race for that for me!  If there had still been there at 21, then definitely :)  I popped another gel and pushed through the slightly nagging knee and hip twinges I was feeling.

### Miles [11] to [20]
The race is almost a horseshoe shape---you run up one side of the lake, down the other, then back again.  We hit mile 11 and turn to go toward the other side of the lake.  And I realize that the split is higher up than what I told my family.  This part of the race is even more isolated than the last part---it's on a paved trail that goals through the woods, through the new (and (possibly hazardous)[http://www.onondaganation.org/news/2016/dont-drink-the-water-and-avoid-going-in-the-bushes-at-the-amphitheater-too/]) amphitheater, which was cool, but also kind of weird as you are running through the main aisle area.  We're in the middle of the woods and I'm think ""shit, my mom is going to think I broke a leg or died or something"".  Around the half point I break out my cell phone and shoot a quick text to my dad ""11 split high. At 13"" (later I found out they thought I meant I was running high 11 miles, slower than what I had told them, and were worried something was wrong. So I didn't help hahah).  I hit the half spilt at 2:10 and was pleased--this is near my PR (2:06) and I was feeling good.  Plus this gave me 2:20 for the second half to hit my goal of less than 4:30. This part of the run got a bit windier and pretty much as soon as I hit mile 14 I hit an emotional wall.  Uh oh. My legs were okay, my lungs were okay, but my mind was failing.  This part of the run was very isolated and the lack of course support was really hitting me. The views were absolutely gorgeous though, of the changing trees and the perfect water.  The clouds had cleared and it was an absolutely picturesque fall day.  I started adding in some walking segments-- 0.10 miles every mile at first.  The support from other runners started to pull me back up and I tried to keep pushing on.  I hit 18 miles at 3:04.  I had done the 18.12 Challenge in 2:59, so I was still doing reasonably well at this point, though I could tell I was going to be struggling soon.  I guzzled down another gel (which was becoming harder as the breathing issue returned and the water stations were spread every two miles).

You come out of the woods at mile 19 and head back down the original trail through the park.  I was doing a LOT of math throughout these miles (2 more 5ks to go, that's just 3 more 2 mile runs, that's a normal Friday run, you can do this), trying to motivate myself and keep me focused.

### Miles [20] to [23]
As we wound back through the park I started to get a bit emotional.  At this point I knew I would crawl if I needed to, to get across that line and get my medal.  I came back to my family at mile 21 and almost started crying.  My parents dog almost decided to join me at this point hahah apparently she hadn't seen me the first go around and tried to get on the path with me.  I shouted to them that I would see them in less than an hour and continued soldiering on.

At like, 21.3 my quad started to have an insane pain rip through it.  I seriously though my muscle was tearing.  I didn't want to stop moving and tried to bend down to stretch a little while I slowed to a walk.  It helped a little but I could feel the other muscles in my legs saying ""uh nuh, don't do that again or we'll shut down"".  I massaged it a few seconds and went back into a jog.  It was feeling okay and I continued on my way.  At this point I was reduced to running .40, walking .10.  I was trying to push through, knowing I was getting so close to the 4:30 time mark, but knowing I didn't have much left.  I downed my last gel and prayed it would help (it was one with caffeine at least!)

### Miles [23] to [26.2]
These miles went back onto the Onondaga Lake Parkway, which is just that, a parkway.  Direct sunlight at this point, all concrete, and all straight with no end in site.  I was feeling it at this point, especially after passing the last waterstop at 24.2.  ""Just keep going swimkid07, just keep going"".  I was repeating that mantra to myself over and over again.  I was forcing myself to stick to the run .40, walk .10 method (instead of just walking whenever...this forced me to continue running). I had some chews with me two and broke out two of those as a desperate attempt to get any energy I could. I knew at this point that 4:30 was out of reach, but that under 4:40 was still feasible.  I rounded the corner by the 81 Interstate entrance, thanked the police office, and started tearing up as I saw the transportation center (which I knew was right by the stadium).  I hear my sister screaming for me and I see her next to my parents' car, behind a fence in a parking lot. I wave and yell that I'll meet her at the finish.  She yells back that my parents are there waiting (she had gone back to feed and change my nephew I found out later).  I turn one corner and start to slow to a walk.  I'm just so exhausted at this point.  I look up and can see the finish line blow-up in the distance.  ""Okay, you can do this,"" I think to myself one more time, forcing myself back to a run.  My watch shows 26.2 (at 4:33) but I knew I was .15-.20 ahead of the official mile markers.  I start to tear up as I realize I'm actually doing this.  I see a race photographer and pull myself together (this race had free photos; I'm notorious for horrible race pictures and was conscious the whole race of not looking like I wanted to murder a photographer hahah).  As I turn the last corner I hear my parents yelling for me and see their signs.  I smile and wave and take off in as much of a sprint as I can must at this point (probably the same speed that a sloth runs but whatever).

I can see the timer says 4:36 as I get close and I know I've at least made my B goal.  I can feel the relief flow over me as I realize that I actually DID this.  I ran a marathon.  I didn't get injured again!  

### Post-race
I cross that line and get my medal and water from two very nice ladies.  My parents are at the finish chute by the time I stop gasping for breath (the perks of a small race!) and we chat for a few minutes as I grab sweatpants and a long sleeve shirt from my mom.  They walk around into the post-run area (again, perks of a small race) and I go to get my free beer and watch for my friends to finish.  They ended up having a rougher race, but still finished and were still thrilled with their results.  I buy a second beer, we all get Dinosaur BBQ, and I make the mistake of sitting in the grass to enjoy and play with my nephew.  My legs dislike this plan.  But the BBQ and beer were worth it.

**TLDR: Isolated course at a small race for my first full.  Official results were 4:35.36!  Beer and BBQ were had by all.**

I signed up for the Portland Marathon after hearing so many rave reviews about the great weather and flatter course that was so friendly to beginner marathon runners. Now, I'm just sad.

Mile 26.2 - oh dear god, where is my husband? I finished. I need dry clothing! (His description of how he found me was ""psychologically damaged"")

Overall worst part: because of the weather, a lot of the music/distraction tents had pretty much stopped performing. We ended up running underneath trees with large splashes of rain, on the side of the road, in order to avoid the misting/rain coming off cars... all while watching people huddle under tents with their warm beverages and mediocre spirits. 

Despite the massive blisters, hypothermia and contemplation of life and death, I finished. Damn it, I finished a full marathon. ","[RACE REPORT] Sorry Portland,"

                | First Marathon | Second Marathon
----------------|----------------|----------------
What/Where/When | 2015 Hartford Marathon, Oct. 10 | 2016 Hartford Marathon, Oct. 8
Why | I found I could run again after I had lost a bunch of weight and I wanted to set a goal. I didn't know what I was getting myself into. | Originally this was going to be the focus of my year, but later my wife discovered the Brooklyn Marathon. It's six weeks later and I switch my focus to it. \(It didn't really make sense to sign up for it, but my wife and I got excited. We don't always make the most sensible plans when enoying a few drinks.\) So this has become an especially intense training run.
Pre-training | About a year of regular trail hiking. I only ran a few times before starting the traing plan. (Not the best idea, I know now. I only got one minor injury. Perhaps my slow paces protected me!) | After Hartford I upped my milage and running days, going up over 50 miles and 6 days/week. I also ran occasional races. Also, after actually gaining some weight after Hartford, I lost about 20 lbs through calorie counting.   
Training | 18-week Higdon Novice 1 and 2 (They are very similar. I felt good in the second half of training so I'd run the slightly higher milage of the Novice 2 plan most weeks.) | I'm on week 12 of a modified Pfitz 18/55 plan scheduled to end 11/20 for the Brooklyn Marathon. (I like to run 6 days a week and there's a 10K loop I really like, so I run some extra recovery miles.) I adjusted it to fit in a mini-taper for this race: I switched weeks around to put a ""recovery"" week two weeks out and did the last week of the plan in the week before the race.
Conditions | Great weather | Great weather (cloudy, 53℉ - 64℉)
Course | Flat. Tbe half and full runners start together next to Bushnell park. You run around the city a bit and split after around a mile. The nicest parts are running along the river and the long out-and-back from around miles 13 - 21 (the out-and-back is mostly nice CT country and the people living along it are great, even though their road is shut down.) | same
Race | Ran at a consistent 10:48 pace for most of it. Began to lose steam in the last few miles and outright bonked in the last mile and ended up a little over 11-minute pace. | Came out a little too fast but eventually managed to slow down and settle in. A little after half way i had to stop for an unavoidable 3-min bio-break and fell behind 4-hour target, but moved along nicely after. I slowed down a little at the end. I had a weak last mile *again*, though no where near as bad as last year (In fact, it was faster than any mile last year.)
Fueling | A big bowl of oatmeal and OJ before. During the race I took the Gatorade at each station and a GU. It wasn't quite enough. | Homemade buttermilk pancakes before. Four GU-type things during the race and I took the Gatorade at almost every station.
Weight | 192 lbs | 176 lbs
Height (just to put my weight in perspective) | 5'11"" | 5'11""
Age | 47 | 48
Goal | Finish (yes!) | sub-four hours (yes!)
Bottom Line | 4:49 | 3:59 

&amp;nbsp;

Up next is the Brooklyn Marathon, Nov. 20. Overall, things went well yesterday, so I don't know if I'll end up doing better. I'll have a proper taper and hopefully won't need a lenghy bio-break, but who knows if I'll end up with such great weather and feeling as good.
",Hartford Marathon: Comparing my first and second marathons
firstmarathon,"Hi guys, 

I'm planning on doing the SF marathon next July and have recently started running (couple of 3/4/5 mile runs at sub 9 min pace). However, my main sport is ultimate (frisbee) and I have training twice a week for that which consists of sprinting and weightlifting. 

How do I build a training plan around this? Most other plans seem to require regular long distance running during the week. Can I use these trainings as prep for the marathon?

",Running my first marathon - NYC Marathon and want to know if my last month of training seems OK?
firstmarathon,"I'm training for my first marathon (Nov 27). I've run 3 half-marathons before and a bunch of 5ks and 10ks. Half-marathon time is 2:00-2:15. 

So,  I didn't really choose a plan when I started training 3 months ago. I started out running 3 miles every day, plus a midweek 5-mile run and long run of 7 miles on Saturday with Sunday off. I just slowly upped the mileage for each day, adding one mile to the midweek and long run each week and waiting til that length felt easy.

So right now, I'm running 5-6 miles per day, midweek 9-10 miles, long run 16 miles. 5-6 miles- 8:20, 9-10 miles- 9:10, 16 miles- 9:30. (Averages)

Should I continue training this way? How do I taper and when should I start?

Also, I had a minor surgery and can't run at all this week. Should I take some mileage off or just start where I left off? How will it impact my timeline to the marathon? 

Tl;dr I am a running noob and don't know how to train with a taper, please help",So I sort-of had a training plan but need advice
firstmarathon,"Background: I started running almost exactly one year ago. I had never run more than probably 6 miles, but I had years of tennis under my belt. I ran a half marathon in December (2:15-ish). Then I didn't do anything until February.

I decided to train for a July marathon and started Hal Higdon's novice program. In May I realized the full marathon I planned to run was only a half. So I looked for another full and ran the half for fun. (just under 2:00)

I re-started-ish the Higdon program but bumped it up to Intermediate I instead. It went well until the volume + my normal tennis got so bad that my heel would hurt and I couldn't run optimally.

Finally, a couple weeks before the Lakefront Marathon (Oct 2), I got some shoe inserts (I have high arches, got Superfeet Green insoles). They *immediately* made a huge difference. Within a week it was like I'd never been in pain. (I also cut the last two weeks down to Novice I again to reduce volume and aid in recovery, ran a few of my miles in grass rather than pavement (slowed me down but less hard impact), and played less tennis.)

My simple goal was to finish. Realistic-ish goal was break 5:00. Dream goal was to break 4:20-ish (10 min mile). Since I'd done a sub-2 half, I figured the 5 was pretty achievable.

Boy I was wrong. If you subtract the ""wait in line for the bathroom at mile 14"" time, I did just barely slip in under 5:00. But the chip time was 5:04.

I managed to never walk until mile 21. On 21, I had to stretch badly. I could feel the upper part of my hamstrings where they insert were stiff. It was colder (rained at least the first couple hours of the race) than I was used to. I'd done most of my training in Texas before moving to MKE, which meant humid 80+ F days, including when I was running 18 and 20 miles first thing in the morning.

I ended up walking a whole mile at one point to try to recover. Stretched some more. Jogged starting mile 23, and then I realized at mile 24 that if I pushed it, I could finish under 5:00 (I'd stopped my watch while waiting for the bathroom so I could track pace accurately to help me stay running).

I ran mile 24 in about 9:50 and mile 25 in about 10:20. The final .2 I was dead on sprinting until I knew I'd get there. I could barely bend over the slight bend necessary for the guy to put my finisher's medal around my neck.

But I felt so accomplished and proud that I'd made it. I actually finished with plenty of energy left in the tank, but it was my leg muscles themselves that didn't have the strength. You probably know what I mean.

Basically, I reserved too much for too long, and then I didn't have the strength to deplete my glycogen stores or whatever it is that is the energy. It was like how you might be well-rested, but a torn muscle still won't work.

This morning, I woke up. My achilles was inflamed like crazy. My quads were DOMS out the wazoo. No problem about the quads. As a tennis player and weightlifter, I know how to deal with that.

But the Achilles was brutal. I am barely able to move about. I had to crawl up and down the stairs at my house all day. I'm filled with a ton of Motrin right now. Foam rolling my left calf because it's knotting up something fierce. I can barely dorsiflex my heel more acutely than 90 degrees. It's a nasty feeling. And it's likely from the big push the last 2.2 miles.

I noticed on medium runs that if I ran 9 minute pace, no big deal. But if I pushed faster, my heel would be awful the next day from the pounding. I suspect something like that happened this time.

So after reflecting on all this, my takeaways that I think I should pass on to future first-time marathoners:

# if you are injured, take time off to recover!!!!!!

# having a reasonable-ish goal will help you push at the end

# day after will feel worse than the immediate post-race feelings

# the jump from 20 miles in training to 26.2 miles is wayyyy bigger than you are hoping, so be mentally prepared for it

Seriously, my first 20 miler, I got home and immediately started helping my wife load up our furniture into a moving van. I was tired, but I was able to walk and lift just fine. But I am a worthless wreck of nothing right now. So mentally prepare yourself for it.",Just finished my first marathon (Milwaukee Lakefront) yesterday [notes inside]

Marathon date is Sat 4/22/17, and my Saturdays/Sundays during the ~18 week training session will be spent on the ski hill and not doing any distance.  Right now I'm thinking of using the Higdon Novice 1 program and shifting the long run day to Thursday rather than Friday, giving me Friday rest day in between long run and weekend skiing.

firstmarathon,"My first real marathon attempt is less than two weeks out (I actually completed my first last year, but due to an injury ended up walking most of it, so I still consider this my first real attempt), and I've decided I'd like to join a pace group, but I'm agonizing over what pace to choose. For up to 12 miles, I run an almost perfectly consistent 10:30 pace, although on my long runs I tend to slow down quite a bit after 12-15. I finished my 20 with an 11:44 average pace.

My first thought was to join the 4:45 pace group, which would be a nice conservative 11:00 pace for the race. I'd be happy with that for sure, but I'm wondering if I'll actually have a better experience if I push myself a bit?

firstmarathon,"Thank you /firstmarathon running community for helping me accomplish my goal of finishing my first marathon! During my training, I relied on benchmarks from other peoples' experiences, so I hope this (long-winded post) can be useful for those of you who are in the midst of training :) 

A bit about my running background -- I ran my first half marathon several years ago (finished in 2:47ish) and then stopped running altogether. In the meantime, I became overweight, completely inactive, and overall unhappy. Last summer, I tried to start running again and finished a 10k in 1:30. After that experience, I decided I wanted to get serious about running and lose the weight I'd gained. 

I lost 30 pounds from October-March and started running consistently in the meantime -- (2+ miles every other day.). For reference, I'm a 23 year old female, 5'4"", current weight 130 pounds. 

My average pace went from 13-14 min/mile to 11-12 min/mile in the midst of that weight loss, and I started training for a June half marathon using the Hal Higdon Novice 1 HM plan. I PRed in my June half marathon by close to 20 minutes, finishing in about 2:20. 

After that half marathon, I decided to dive on in and sign up for my first marathon. I strictly followed Hal Higdon's Marathon 1 training plan and only missed 1 4-mile run the entire training cycle. In efforts to not get injured, I did zero speed work and ran each run for completion. 

My 3-5 mile runs would be anywhere from 11-12 min/mile, my mid-week long runs would usually end up at a pace between 12-13, and then my weekend long runs would be anywhere from 11-15 mins/mile. 

My weekend long runs were not the best: for most of my runs over 13 miles, I would start walk/running for the last few miles. These are some of my pace splits for the long runs:

20 milers: 13:07 moving pace/ 14:22 pace including stops. The first 13 miles were at a 12:15 pace, but then I ran into heat and stomach issues that had me (mostly walk) the last 7 miles.

15 miles: 12:53 pace

18 miles: 12:37 moving pace/14:15 pace including stops. First 10 miles was a 13:07 pace, last 8 miles was a 15:47 pace. 

17 miles: 12:57 moving pace/14:05 pace including stops. Overall that run actually went well except for a 10 minute bathroom break at mile 15 after a Gu Gel didn't go down well.

The time limit for my marathon was 6 hours, and with those long runs I had a lot of doubt that I could finish in time. (My pace doesn't seem to line up with my half marathon PR -- plugging that time into race calculators gave me an expected finish time of sub-5 hours, but I knew with how awfully my long runs went that wouldn't even be in the realm of possibility haha.)

In the end, my main goal was to simply finish under the time limit and enjoy my time, and I was able to accomplish that! 

The actual marathon went very well -- I went into the race with an A goal of 5:30, B goal of 5:45, and C goal of anything under 6 hours.

It was overcast and 60-70 degrees with humidity and wind, but overall the conditions didn't bother me. I decided my strategy was to intentionally go out a bit faster than my expected end pace with the idea that my second half would be slower than my first half. I finished the first half in 2:40 without much ado -- my nutrition and hydration were going well and I had no cramping or pain. 

At that point, I expected that I could possibly finish my A goal, so I kept up the 12-12:30 pace. After mile 15, though, I started getting blisters and my legs got really sore. I then realized that this had happened in all my training runs, so I was being a bit naive in thinking this wouldn't happen in my marathon haha!

I adjusted my running to a 2:1 run/walk ratio with the hopes of still finishing in my B goal of 5:45. However, by mile 18, I got tired, the mosquitoes started biting, one of my blisters broke open, and I became slightly unhappy. And so I took a nice long walking break and decided -- there is some beautiful scenery around here, I've already had a great race, I have more than enough time to run/walk to obtain my C goal, and I just want to enjoy the rest. (Translation: I decided I didn't really want to ""push through the pain."")

And so... I moseyed through miles 18-24, enjoying the scenario, running when I felt like it, and allowing quite a few people to pass me. Finally, I ran the last 1.5 miles to finish in 5:54. 

So... I did it! I know there are people out there who would argue I didn't officially ""run a marathon"" once a big chunk of my second half was walking, but I achieved my goal of having a pleasant race and finishing under the 6 hour time limit. Next time I do a marathon -- and there will definitely be a next time -- I already know my goal will be to run the whole thing :)

At 3k to go I lost all steam and started getting just exhaused. I lost my ""buffer"" and was right on pace, 2k from finish I was speed walking/jogging a 8:10 km and I was pushing to finish strong.

I also feel completely wiped out the whole day. It could be getting up at 4:30a - 5:00a to run these.  It's hard for me to take a nap, so that probably has something to do with it. I don't think I am overdoing it. I am keeping all my runs aerobic checking them with a HRM to make sure I stay within that zone most of the time.

Other than that, training is going fine. I hit 16 next weekend then take a rest week at 12 I believe. Almost to the 20 miler in October!

Any tips?",How to deal the hungers after long runs?

firstmarathon,"Hey guys, I'm doing the Berlin Marathon in about 2 weeks as my first marathon and I'm feeling extremely underprepared as I was injured about a month or so ago which really put me out of training.
I had covered about 30km (18mi) the last long run I did but I think around the 23km mark my left ankle started to hurt which I sort of tried to push through until I reached home.
For the next week I was not in excruciating pain, but it did hurt a ton (my right ankle started to hurt as well because I assume I compensated supporting my weight onto the right foot). After it felt like it had cleared up, I tried t go for a run again but only managed to cover about 2 or 3km before my ankle started hurting again, in which the pain continued for the rest of the day. It was at this point i decided to really let it heal but also I started to get extremely busy with work and preparing to move overseas.

Now I'm in Berlin with about 2 weeks to go, looking for a place to live but also stressing that I won't be able to make the distance to run (I have gone on probably 2 runs max 10km since I arrived here).

I'm quite concerned that firstly I won't reach my goal of completing the marathon in under 4:00 or 3:45 (if we're being realistic at this point i'm most likely not going to get that) and more importantly whether or not I'll even finish the whole distance.

Does anyone have any tips??",Feeling very unprepared for first marathon
firstmarathon,"Hello!

I'm running my first marathon in a few weeks  and have an A goal of 5:15 and B goal of 5:30... And (worst case scenario) goal of 6 hours once that's when the race ends. Does anybody have a bare-minimum strategy for doing a sub-6 hour race? I've been following Hal Higdon's plan and don't seem too worried, but my biggest concern is starting out too fast. How ""slow"" would somebody recommend running the first half (or 3/4s?) to allow plenty of time for the second half that will inevitably be harder? Thanks!",Strategy for a sub-6 hour marathon
firstmarathon,"Reddit, you're the first person I've told. I want to follow through, and I can't do that by getting premature reward. The first person I'll tell is my mom, about a month before the race, I figure she should know since she's my emergency contact and a plane ride away.

Anyways, this morning I woke up at 4 AM and just started running went something like 38 minutes and went 3.2 miles. I'm happy with that pace, that's actually the number that I arbitrarily picked to be my pace when I signed up.

But that was the furthest I've ever run. And training plans suggest starting at 5 miles as the most distance and running for 30-45 minutes every day. I guess it's something like Tues-Sat run 30-45 minutes and on Sunday go the most you can do. What do I do? 30-45 minutes is my current limit.

And also is the app 'Way to Marathon' a good training app, or should I use another one? Also, my shoes seem cheap, but that might be because they are running shoes and are supposed to be light-weight, how do I tell if they are bad quality or good quality? I got them for free, but in a unique circumstance where they might be good. 

As for the rest of my wardrobe, I was just wearing a T-shirt today, is this good? Should I get something else? The shorts I wore today had an internal lining, and a zipper pocket on my bum, I liked them, is this the best style? The rest of my shorts are basketball and soccer, no support and big pockets, I am not excited to wear those, I liked having my phone measure my distance, but maybe I could get a pedometer. My socks were thick is there a such thing as running socks? And finally, pardon me if it's TMI, but I stopped trying to be athletic a while back when I kept getting fungal infections, and something similar to testicular torsion, but thankfully not nearly as bad. I myself David Archy's MicroModal boxer briefs, and for casual wear it has been great at moisture control and support. But I haven't worked out in a long time. It was cool out today, so I don't know if the underwear really worked or if it wasn't hot enough. But I don't want to find out, especially because it won't be till the end of training that it starts to heat up. Thoughts?

Any other suggestions would be nice too. Thanks in advance!",I signed up for my first marathon last night. 242 days to go. Training plan starts November 7th. I ran the furthest I've ever ran today at 3.2 miles.
firstmarathon,"I've been following Hal Higdon's Novice 1 Marathon plan religiously since the start of my marathon training 4 months ago. I haven't missed a SINGLE workout and my short runs range anywhere from 10:30 min/mile pace - 12:00 min/mile pace, and my longer runs range from 12 min/mile pace - 14 min/mile pace. I've done 15-18 mile runs in an ok fashion -- a bit difficult but I never felt like they were impossible.

Anyways...I was doing fantastic in my training until yesterday's 20 mile run. As fellow Higdon follows know, the 20 mile run is the longest run before tapering. Well... The first 12 miles went fantastic at a 12:00 - 12:30 pace, but then the last 8 miles were absolute crap. I averaged 15 - 19 min miles for those last miles (except for the last mile, which I willed back up to a 12:30 pace.) Not sure if it was the humidity or dehydration, but it was the worst run I've ever been on...

Am I totally screwed for my marathon in 3 weeks from now? I had put this 20 miler on a huge pedestal for training and it was a total flop... Now I fear that my marathon will end the same way and I won't finish in the 6 hour time limit :o

firstmarathon,"So I ran my first marathon on Monday and found myself really slowing down and hitting a wall -- a wall lined with barbed wire and spiked glass, with guard dogs and snipers -- after mile 20. It made me wonder why training runs generally only go up to 20 miles. Because there are 6.2 more miles of pain after 20, and I found those to be easily the hardest parts of the course, for which I didn't have any preparation or experience. I was really in uncharted waters. ",Training vs. Marathons -- Why only 20-mile runs
firstmarathon,"I am 5 weeks out from my marathon. I was set to run 20 miles in 2 weeks, but have an overnight with friends and know coming back from that it won't happen, and it's wedding related so can't reschedule. No biggie, I moved it up a week. 

But today, despite only planning 18, the weather was nice and my brain was still doing OK. You know, I hadn't convinced myself to walk besides refuel breaks, or convince myself I couldn't do it. So I decided to just get my 20 over with. My understanding is the body needs to get miles in, but the 20 is as much for that as for you mentally.

I'm really sore now and stretching lots. Not sure if doing the 20 mile 5 weeks out instead of planned 3 or updated plan 4 weeks out was a good idea, but mentally I'm just glad to have it behind me!

firstmarathon,,Runner's World Episode 21: Run Your Best Marathon
firstmarathon,"Last year I ran a half-marathon. It was relatively easy for me, so this year I decided to do a full marathon. I signed up in the spring and have been training for it for a good while now.

I regularly run around 14 km every day or every second day. My longest run was 28 km some weeks ago. Generally, I feel fit and ready for the marathon.

But! One and a half week ago, while running for about 25-ish km, I noticed a stinging pain in my left knee, which I had never experienced before. It grew stronger and stronger, so I eventually had to stop and walk home. My knee kept hurting for days, even when I didn't run.

Since my marathon was coming up soon, I decided to take a break and hoped it would go away. I ran maybe every third or fourth day, but after a few km the pain slowly came back. This made me very nervous, so I decided to more or less stop running just until now. Today I tried running again, but about the 8-9 km mark, the knee pain came back.

While walking back home, I slowly had to accept that I simply cannot do the maraton this Sunday --- not even a half-marathon. This was very hard for me to swallow, since I have been practicing for the marathon for about half a year (even more if I include the regular ""normal"" running that I have been doing since my half-marathon last year) and really looked forward to it. But participating with my current condition would be stupid; I don't want to risk a permanent knee injury! Since I live in a smal country, I am not sure when the next marathon will be, but when I am ready I am definitely going to participate in one.

So, now I have decided to take a break away from running. Maybe I will try out in a month or so again. I recently read Christopher McDougall's book ""Natural Born Heroes"" and got an interest in the Maffetone Method. Maybe I will try that out as well.",My first marathon is this Sunday - but I won't participate

firstmarathon,"I am running my first marathon on Oct 9.  This last Sunday, it happened again.  Two miles into my run, I desperately needed to use the restroom.  This has been a consistent problem for me all summer.  Even more frustrating, I used the restroom (and had a pretty health movement, if you know what I mean) just before heading out for the run.

I know everyone has been there, but I am feeling nervous about how this plays out on race day.  I understand there are toilets at the water stations along the route, but I’d really like to avoid stopping if I can.  Also, I have been running about 10:30/mile this summer and they close the course at a 13:45/mile pace.  So if I stop at the two mile point, I’ll have four minutes to take care of business.

After googling on this problem, I’ve been considering using Imodium, but 1) I feel like if I’m going to use it on race day I should be using it during my long runs and I really only have two left (I run 18 mi this Sunday and 20 the following Sunday before starting to taper) and if I take Imodium before one of them and it prevents me from finishing the long run, I’ve screwed up my training; 2) I can’t recall ever taking Imodium, but I understand it can make you feel drowsy, dizzy, or nauseous, all of which seem like they should be deal breakers for marathon running. 

So what to do?  Right now I’m leaning towards doing my best to clear my bowels the morning of the race and then hope that adrenaline stops everything up.  I guess in the worst case I can use the toilets at the water station.  I really can’t imagine it would take me more than four minutes.  Are there other, better ideas?

firstmarathon,"Hello. I was recently selected to run the NYC Marathon and I have been training for the race for about a month using the Nike+ app. I am a former college athlete and have been a casual runner for a few years. Recently Nike updated their running app and I lost the training program I had been using. The old program was 5 runs a week of vary distances with cross training and rest days mixed in. I have begrudgingly begun a new program on the new app, but the closest date it would let me set was Nov. 14th, about a week after the actually marathon, which has made me a little, but not overly, nervous. The new program is also time based, ex. run 45:00 minutes today as opposed to the old program's distance based training goals, ex. run 5 miles. My question is will I be okay if I suddenly change and start following this new program or should I try to find another distance based program? The event is 2 months away and I'm really just concerned about finishing the race with a respectable time. I can provide further details if necessary. Thank you very much!

firstmarathon,"I'm on week 22 of a 26 week training plan for my first marathon. I've never run more than a 5K before this, so it has been quite the struggle. I'm slow. Like so slow. Take your slow pace, and you will still be speeding past me. I'm averaging a 14 minute mile on my long runs. And I'm not too worried about the speed so much as I am with finishing.

firstmarathon,"Hi everyone, I'm planning on running my first full Marathon at the end of this coming February.

A bit of background, I've always been a pretty healthy person without being too active, (good diet, lots of walking, etc.) and last year my friend convinced me to run a half marathon in November. I started training midway into September (3-4 runs a week) and I couldn't believe that I was able to finish the Half Marathon in 2:14... I really couldn't believe that after a relatively brief period of training I was able to push my body to that extent.

I registered for my second half marathon the following April in 2016 and trained even more, even though my time on this half was 2:15, I felt very accomplished because of how much more difficult the  course was (very, very hilly for almost the whole run).

I've become so fascinated that I was able to do this I want to push myself even further and am going to try a full marathon and the end of February. I'm having trouble finding a running schedule online for beginners... A lot of them require an app subscription or a purchase.

I'm going to start training at the beginning of September. Only thing to keep in mind, and I'm not sure if its a good thing or not, but I'm also running the same half marathon I ran last year, on November 8. Maybe that lines up good with the training schedule? I'm not sure.

I'm hoping to get a time of less than 5 hours which I think is reasonable. If I get 4:30 I would be over the moon with joy.

Any advice? Is this a reasonable goal? Is running a half marathon in the middle a bad choice? Can anyone point me in the direction of a good beginner marathon training schedule?

firstmarathon,"Ha it's stupid, I realize this. I accepted a spot in this marathon exactly 12 weeks out from the race. Due to some unavoidable trips and distractions, I have put off  starting any regimented training plan until now. At 31, I have always been active and in shape but never really considered myself a runner. Most of my runs prior to this floated between 2 and 4 miles.

I am about 6 years out from that shape, but I have been running off and on 5 or 6 miles a day 2 or 3 times a week since high school sometimes way less, and rarely a little more.

firstmarathon,"Last night after a pretty good circuit workout, I went to hit the showers at my gym. Put on my flip flops, took off my glasses, and cleaned up for the drive home. 

Now I'm half-blind without my specs, and when walking back to my locker I made the mistake of walking too close to a wooden bench. Made the turn, didn't see the leg, and connected my right pinky toe squarely across the corner. The initial wave of pain nearly turned my stomach, but the slow dawning realization of what had just happened deserves equal credit for the nausea. I broke my toe 14 weeks out from my first marathon.

Fully granting the ridiculousness of this next part, I believe I've hit nearly all of the stages of grief in the past twenty-four hours. I've denied that the blasted appendage is broken. I've been more than angry that such a stupid accident can sideline me right at the point when my long runs started ramping up into double digits. I've even bargained with myself, agreeing that if I actually took the time off to heal and didn't run, I would splurge and buy a new GPS watch with a heart rate monitor. 

Haven't hit acceptance, but I hear that stubborn refusal to accept limitations is a character trait shared by many runners. 

Sitting here, wishing that damn piggy would have just gone to the market like he was supposed to, I've been trying to game plan. Consensus seems to be that two weeks is a minimum time off before testing. For my schedule, that means missing 51 miles and puts me coming back just in time for a 14 miler. Though I could have cleared 14 no problem on Wednesday, I suspect that mileage would not be wise to attempt after a two week break (mixture of fitness loss and aggravation of toe injury). So, I've got a decision to make. Do I chart a gradual ramp up to get back on schedule for mileage under this plan or find a 12 week plan and start over? One of the advantages of my current plan is that a large group runs the long runs on Saturday mornings, and I really enjoy running with and learning from those folks. If I started a 12 week plan, I imagine that the stresses would not be as bad as trying to catch up, but I would probably have to leave that group. 

All of that assuming that I'm healed up and good to train after two weeks.

As per most of the online race prediction calculators(Jack Daniels, Hanson, Cool Running), I should be able to finish my marathon in 4h30m. (The calculators are within 1-2% accuracy for other distance paces).

I dropped out of my second marathon at mile 20 this year (around 3h50m mark), due to the cold and rain ~ 45F/7-8C, for over 4 hours near the shore and after that I was not able to run anymore. I just had to stop, and could not start again.

firstmarathon,"I ran all throughout high school, took a few years off and have been running for the past two years again. I'm training for a marathon in October and my milage of last week was 27 miles (following Higdon Novice 1 program).

Anyway, what I noticed before my 7 miles run yesterday was that the bottom of my feet are ""molting."" Basically parts of the top layer of skin are coming loose and peeling off in areas such as the webbing between my big toe and the one next to it, both those toes where they make contact (the side next to the nails), the bottom of my pinky toes, and the ball of my feet (pinky side).

There is no traditional chaffing in these areas, the areas don't irritate me, nor cause any pain. I use synthetic socks, have shoes that have been properly fitted by my local running store, and stay well hydrated on my runs.

I'm halfway through a marathon training plan (first one in late October). For the past few years, my fitness plan was based around lifting but I ran 2-3x per week and had a good 5k time. Most of my running consisted of sprints or 400-800m intervals, but I could run 6 miles easily and did one half marathon last year.

Now, though, I've found that I'm losing speed and muscular strength, without much added endurance benefit. Even a medium length run is hard to finish unless I'm sticking to an 8-9 min/mile pace. And while I still go to the gym, I've noticed a definite loss in upper body strength.

I asked her if I was okay to keep training, and she said it would be fine as long as I was eating enough. I checked out /r/gainit, but it seems to be almost exclusively dudes who lift, and I vaguely know of the general philosophy that cardio kills gains.

I am following a Hal Higdon plan, the novice one. Or I will be, my training begins July 5th. I am sure I can get the distance, but what I am not sure about is fueling and hydrating.

On the 1/2 marathon, I ate sport jelly beans at mile 6 and drank 2-3 cups for water and I did fine. 

I am trying to research on how to do this for a marathon and I get a lot of different advice.  One thing says to drink every 15 minutes. That'll be hard if the water stops for this race is every 2 miles. I see where it recommends an energy gel or two every 45m-1h.

So with all this my plan is to try: drinking Gatorade every 2 miles (hitting all the water stops) and popping a gel or two every hour. I can simulate this during my training runs.

On the water stops, do I just need one cup of fluid or should I do two? How much are in each cup?

I am also not sure what to use to carry water/Gatorade during my training runs. Waist things tend to make my back hurt a bit.

firstmarathon,,CHARITY MARATHON RUN
firstmarathon,"Big thank you to this board which I (sometimes obsessively) poured over before running my first marathon.  Here's a bit of a recap:

One month before the race was set to run our last longest run (32 km) and woke up with a horribly sore and swollen throat.  I'm thinking strep throat but the walk in clinic doctor tells me it's just a cold, gargle with salt water and utilize advil.  Sore throat persists for remaining month of training but it's somewhat tolerable with advil and I'm hell bent and determined to finish this marathon and just figured that I'm not getting over the cold due to all of the mileage.

Day of the race I still have a sore throat and swollen neck.  Shit.  Take some advil and head out anyway.  Race begins and I'm feeling OK.  Not as good as I normally feel after tapering and starting a race, but not horrible either.  Our race started with the half marathon distance and so we were on the same course for the first 10 km and I ran with a friend who was doing the half, which was really enjoyable, however I think I pushed too fast for the first bit.  

I kept running at a decent clip for the first half and it felt like it was all uphill for those 21 km!  At this point it starts to get hot outside and I start to feel really fatigued.  At around 28 km I feel really really extremely tired and think about giving up but glance at my wrist where my mom has preemptively given me a bracelet engraved with ""She believed she could so she did"" and so I figure ""well, she already bought me the bracelet, I better finish""

By 32-33 km my feet are sore, I am dragging myself forward and time feels like it has stood still.  I can see across the street the people who are at 36 km on their way back to the finish line and see some friends.  I'm surprised I have the energy to holler my support at them, but there it is.  

Just before I get to the last turn around point, I see my training partner, who I had assumed was WAY WAY far ahead since I'm struggling so much with fatigue and heat.  He has a quick moment to say ""I'm dead"".  This inspires me to pick up my pace to go and help him through whatever he's going through.  I've trained with my friend for 2 years now and we have done countless races together.  The first time I ran 32 km I was not doing well and he helped me get through it.  It was time to step up and return the favor!

I caught up to him at about 34-35 km and he has what turns out to be heat exhaustion and his muscles are cramping up and so painful he is struggling to walk.  So I walked with him and asked him to run to different points when he could and kept telling him that we were so close, there was no way he was quitting now.  

I stop to use a portopotty at 40 km and as I'm pulling my pants up, I see one of the armbands, which I've managed to keep with me for 39 km after I pulled them off at the first km, has fallen in front of the urinal in a puddle of someone's pee.  I quietly pull the second armband from my waist pack and leave it with it's brother and bid them both a fond farewell.

I stayed with my friend until the last km and told him that I knew he could make the last 1, I just needed to run into the finish to see my family and I'd be there waiting for him when he came in.  With about 200 meters to go, my stepdaughters saw me and ran the finish line with me.  I'm ugly crying at this point because I'm so pleased to be finished and have a beer already!  Well that and I finished my first MARATHON!

For about 1 hour following the finish I told anyone who would listen that I would NEVER do another one in my life, no no no no no no no!  

I visited my family doctor two days later and she was shocked and appalled that I had run a marathon.  My neck was so swollen she thought I had mono, I most definitely had strep throat and/or tonsilitis.  Many tests later, no mono (thank goodness!) just a long ass case of strep throat!  So that's the story of how I ran my first marathon with strep throat.  Now certainly I have to try another one without strep throat just to compare the two ;)

firstmarathon,Hello- Just started training for my first marathon. I have looked at several training plans. I am somewhat confused about the total number of miles that you should train during the week? I know the long runs are on Saturday are Sunday.  I noticed that during the week some plans just call for 13 miles during the week plus the long run? Then other plans call for running 5 days per week and it looks like during the week 20 miles per week not including the long run? Then I watched a documentary about training for a marathon and they advised 45-50 miles per week plus a long run on the weekend.  I would just like to know total miles per week. ?? Hope this makes sense? -Thanks!!,Average Number of miles per week?

firstmarathon,"I'm training for the Disney Marathon in January. Never really ran before this year other than occasional community 5k races. Got the itch this year to be consistent with health and fitness. The Disney Marathon sounds like a lot of fun, allows me to visit family, and is the big goal I needed to stick with running for more than a few weeks.

I read a lot of training programs and found 2 local races that would be my benchmark goals this year: a 10K this past weekend, and a half-marathon in late September. Each allows me about 3 months prep.

My first month training for the 10K was exciting, fulfilling, and COLD! Most every run was 25-30 degrees F out there. Definitely good weather to not overheat! But the wind did make it hard some days to get out there.

About 6 weeks in, the next 2 weeks at work were going to be very long and often stressful hours. So I decided to ease up on running for those 2 weeks. Turns out I didn't run at all. That was a serious lesson: even if I thought about taking it easy I would just skip too many runs. Realized I had to just stick with my run days even if my runs had to be cut very short. Training for a marathon IS a part-time job with no vacation. Planning to scale back for 2 weeks due to work really meant not running for 2 weeks.

Injuries suck. Just 3 miles into my first run after the 2 week break, my knee hurt like crazy. Reading online lead me to understand it was my IT band. That ruined about 6 weeks of running. Couldn't run more than 10-15 minutes a day. Learned a lot about conditioning my whole body during that recovery.

So with 8 weeks of either no running or miserable 1 mile runs, I finally got my body back to running 5+ miles at a time. Felt great to do that again.

And then we built a patio on our house ourselves. With limited time available to move 24 tons of material, every waking minute was spent on that instead of running. That was a conscious decision to put running on hold but I didn't feel bad because the patio was a great workout itself. Running was actually pretty easy after we finished that project.

My 10K raceday arrives. It is hot and sunny. I was nervous about my preparation - was I really ready? (Despite having run much further the week before, an actual starting line was still daunting!)

I finished. Under the goal time I had set 4 months earlier. It is a great feeling and now I can move ahead training for the next benchmark race.",First training goal (10K) completed with some lessons learned.

firstmarathon,"Hi guys, I've been reading here for a couple of days. Just joined reddit so sorry if I do/say something stupid.

**Background**: I've (25M) been running for about 3-4 years now, for mental health/joy/health and fitness/etc. I like to think I am a fairly fit runner. This time last year I was running 8-9 miles 5-6 days a week at an approximately 7:30-8:00 pace depending on the day. I was training for a half when I sprained my ankle very badly playing with my dog in September. Was off until December when I started running seriously again, dropping mileage to ~30 miles/week. This past Sunday I completed my first half marathon with a time of 1:43:38 (goal time was 1:45). I read a lot before the half about what to expect and how I would be in misery, and missed my 11 mile training run because of injury, so I was expecting the worst but it was actually quite easy? I was accelerating continuously from mile marker 7 and sprinted the last 1.1 miles, grinning the entire way.

**The Marathon**: I was previously happy with the 8-9 mile distance and just wanted to race a half for fun. Now I loved the half and want to go for a full. The full marathon I'm looking at is September 25 and the course is flat/net elevation loss. I'm taking this week off (and losing my mind not running) and planned to start Monday with 16 weeks to train.

**The Questions**:

* Is sub-4:00 a reasonable goal/expectation for this marathon? I have 16 weeks to train and am currently at half-marathon fitness.

* What's a reasonable training plan? All the plans I've seen seem to either assume you're starting from 5-10k or you're an advanced marathoner already. I'm tentatively looking at jumping into week 3 of Hal Higdon's Novice 2. Any reason this might be a bad fit/is there a better plan I should be looking at?

* I commute by bike 4 miles uphill each way, which I stopped during the later weeks of my half training schedule. Will the bike commuting be a problem for full marathon training?

* Any other general advice? Is this a bad idea?

Thanks for any advice.",Yet another training plan question...

I had worked everything out, my fueling, I was happy with all my gear. 

There was a variable I didn't control for, and that was weather. 
Sunday was a day like no training day I've had all year. The heat was miserable. The humidity was a wet blanket. The race clock was officially stopped at 4:30, I think they made the course wide announcement closer to 4:00. I struggled all day to keep my hr in check. I wish I had been more patient. Despite maintaining a lower pace, I was clearly pushing too hard. The average HR numbers in my splits don't lie. By the end of mile 18, I was walking then running. Something I've never had to do on long runs or races. I was feeling sick to my stomach, I wasn't sure if I needed more water, or more salt. I should have guessed salt.

I ended up in the med tent after sitting down, and feeling sick to my stomach. I should have walked it off, and kept moving, but I didn't have my wits.

I am extremely happy I finished, despite walking. I should know better than to have a # fixed in my head as a target, especially for a first, especially for a hot race. I feel something is still left unfinished. I may run a marathon again. Despite enjoying the city, and liking the course (mostly), and loving the support, I doubt I'll run this race again.

firstmarathon,"In December last year I decided I wanted to take on a marathon. I had been running a lot that year and did a 10k race in the summer. I started training in January but due to an ankle injury I was only able to do Tai Chi and Qigong. As of February I followed a 16 week program with 3 runs a week: 30 minutes fast, 60 minutes intermediate and 90 minutes comfortable and 3 ""cross-training"" sessions a week (I did Kung-Fu/Tai Chi/Qigong). I had initially signed up for a new Berlin Marathon but this ended up getting cancelled and because I felt like I ""needed"" to run one this May, I decided to find the another one. I found a run that was on a weekend and decided to take a trip down to the mountain town by myself for the weekend and take on my first marathon. For reasons still unclear to me, I had no idea that a ""mountain marathon"" was different than a normal one and really didn't take this into consideration until I was at the bottom of the hill. It took me 5 hours and 24 minutes with two 600 m climbs, we were only 81 runners so most of the race was a solo-mission - somehow I made it and I still can't really believe it. 
I chose to run a marathon because I wanted to really challenge myself physically but also mentally. I am quite self-critical as a person and needed a situation where I had to be my own best friend to accomplish an important goal. To be honest, it worked. I pushed myself, slowed down when I had to, didn't think about the pain in my knee until I was at the end, the three times I wanted to cry I could quickly get my head back into the game (also I can't run and cry at the same time so I was forced to get myself together to keep going) I felt quite prepared physically and mentally - everything went quite well - but ultimately not at all emotionally. 

Now it's been two weeks since the race. I've been to Tai Chi and Qigong a few times since and am back on my bike (biking about 24 km a day) but haven't trusted my body enough to go run. What's really the worst is that I feel so out of it. I feel really empty inside. I know I am proud of myself, I'm impressed and happy I made it but somehow there's something that's blocking that happiness. I'm back at work now and just feel exhausted and uninterested in everything around me. I still go out with my friends and do ""enjoy"" fun things but really I just want to be alone. I don't even want to talk about the race when people bring it up - I feel weirdly embarrassed by the praise. I mean I don't want to broadcast it, but there is no confidence when I talk about it at all.  

Has anyone felt this way after a first run or a big run? How did you deal with it? Does it just go away or did you actively have to do something about it?

firstmarathon,"This was my first ever marathon and what a doozy it turned out to be. The weather was incrediblly bad. Id love for someone else that was there to comment because these were some of the worst conditions I've ever run in. 35F, snow, rain, hail, sleet and the NW wind off of Lake Erie was howling.
Race day I woke up at 415 for the 7am start. We were told to be at the starting line at 6 but honestly it didnt seem to matter. The start of the race was very cool, they had the Cavs pregame hype announcer start us off and the running crowd was pumped to run despite the shitty weather. Although the start wasn't too bad.

Miles 1-13 were great, everything felt great, the precipitation wasn't falling and we were mostly in the city so the wind wasn't a factor. I finished the first half 1:59. I was pleased with that but my main goal was to just finish today. The only thing that bothered me was every porter potty was occupied when there were some on the course. I really had to take piss but ended up holding it until about mile 15.

Miles 13 - 18. Fuckin Hell. We were straight into the wind for these miles. The fuckin' rain, hail and snow was really coming done. At one point I believe around Mile 16 you cross a long bridge with Lake Erie on your right side. I swear I thought my fuckin' fingers had frostbite. Any attempt to move them was unbearable. I was soaked too and freezing. It also crossed my mind that I may get hypothermia. Kept telling myself to stop bitching and keeping on plugging away. At this point I stopped keeping track of my pace and just wanted the turnaround to come so I could put the wind at my back.

Miles 18-26.2 Mile 18 was about where the turnaround was. With the wind at my back it really made a hell of a difference. I felt sorry seeing the poor souls still heading West. Mile 21 I got my first cramp, back of my left hamstring. Walked it out for a minute, drank some powerade and pushed on. Miles 25 and 26 are long slow uphills. I started feeling pretty good at this point knowing the end was near. My legs felt good for just doing 24 miles and I decided to push a little harder. My last mile according to my garmin was my 2nd fastest at 8:45. At the finish line was my wife, daughter and mom were screaming at me, which was so cool to have them out that toughing out the conditions in support of me. Came in at a couple minutes over 4 hours.

I missed a few mid week runs and a few cross training sessions, but not due to excess fatigue or injury. I have certainly felt the increasing load of later three week cycles. The back down weeks have been appreciated, to properly recover but I've never felt over trained. I've even felt eager to run my scheduled runs.

The plan is solid from a running standpoint, as long as you have a solid base (I ran 1k in 2015).

As a dude I'm not afraid to rock the tights, they keep my pieces in the right places, and help keep my knees warm in cooler weather. I wore my racing (lower milage training) shoes. I loaded my fuel belt with water, sports drink, chomps, cash, and 3 gels. I had to run w/ my fuel belt, I hate it. The bounce subtly makes me feel like I'll change my stride, asking for injury. Other than the belt, I tried to make this a race simulation, attire, fueling and pacing similar to my 26.2. Miles .5 - 5 were not noteworthy other than forgetting to start my watch. During a stretch between 5 and 6 I saw a large diameter tree which had some signs a beaver had been working on it. If that beaver thinks it can take down a tree that large with just its teeth, I can do this. At least that was my momentary inspiration. Then I saw road kill on miles 6/7/8, a large frog, a squirrel, and a snake. The progressive reminder I needed to give the road &amp; miles the respect they deserve. Focus on keeping my breathing, pacing, and heart rate in check, and to be aware of my surroundings to avoid joining them on the road. As I approached mile 9, I did my good deed, and removed a recycling bin from the road. I saw 4-5 cars narrowly avoid it, but not stop. During these first 10 miles I drank all my fluids. I was happy to make the detour to grab water, fill bottles and empty my bladder. This is a big change from previous hydration plans, only consuming 14oz. This was worth it, I am positive better hydration improved my performance. Even with temps in the 50's, I was sweating sufficiently. On prior runs I didn't feel dehydrated, but would have drank more. This time, with a pint more water, I empty by mile 20, but feeling good. The only issue was mild knee pain around mile 16, but today it seems fine. I'll definitely ice it and rest it this week. Next up, tapering, and time to go stir crazy.

TLDR - Followed Hal Novice 2, worked for me. Completed 20 miler, and now ready for may 29 first marathon.

firstmarathon,"Finished the Orange County marathon this past Sunday, here's some of the highlights.

Showed up to the start at 5am for a 5:30am start time, I was expecting more runners but it was nice and not too crowded. Had time to get loose and run up and down the block a few times and do some light stretching. I was experiencing some calf pain the week of so went out and bought some compression sleeves and wore one the entire day before and both the day of the race, yes I wore something in my first marathon that I had never ran it before and it actually helped a lot! Legs were warm and felt good. 

Started nice and slow to make sure my calf was loose and not to come out of the gates too quick. My goal was to finish in 4 hrs., somewhere around mile 1.5 I got passed by the 4:20 pacing group and I got frustrated. I really wanted to speed up and catch up to them but told myself it was a long race and I'll have plenty of time to make up ground. 

The first 8 miles felt good, the second 8 felt great! I was in a groove and found my stride. I passed the 4:20 pacer and was getting close to the 4:10 group as well. The first hill was around mile 12 and I noticed a lot of people who had passed me earlier had started to walk up the hill. It felt good that I was still able to run and it boosted my confidence. Still didn't want to up my pace too much, I told myself I should wait until at least mile 20 before I try and push it.

Mile 19 is where the wheels fell off. My fuel plan was Gu every 5 miles, Blocks in between as needed, water at the stations when I felt thirsty. This worked well in my training so I had no reason to change it. I grabbed some water at the mile 19 drink station and instantly got a side cramp. I rarely got cramps while training and they were minor and usually went away in a half mile or so.  This was much worse, it slowed me down quite a bit. I also started to realize just how sweaty and wet I was, I'm a heavy and salty sweater. I stopped at the next aid station and asked for a paper towel. Wiped myself down and tried to push a little harder but that cramp still persisted so I had to go pretty slow. 

The 4:10 group passed me, not long after that the 4:20 group did as well. It was frustrating knowing I wasn't going to be close to my goal time and the finish line felt so far away. At mile 24 I got a sharp pain in my shoulder, at that point I was running on empty and everything was difficult. I had fallen off my fueling plan, worried the Gu would make my side cramp worse. The worst part was I couldn't get a full deep breath in because of the pain in my side. 

Made it through the finish line with a time of 4:26:55. After the finish I was pretty out of it, kept walking, only thing that sounded good was water, not the free gatorade or chocolate milk. Felt out of it and sore the rest of the day and my quads were tight for the next two days, standing up and sitting down was hard. 

I definitely want to do another one and try and break the 4 hour mark. I think I need to fuel better before the race, all I ate before was half a banana, some nuts, and a Block. I may have to force myself out of bed extra early just to get some proper nutrition in.

Do you have any good programs that I could follow? Esp for the lower body exercises? 

Also, how would you estimate what your finishing time would be? I've previously run a couple of half marathon races (hilly and in the forrest) at 2hrs... But that was also 1.5 years ago.

Thanks a lot!",Advice needed for strength training and time expectation for a first marathon
firstmarathon,"**Introduction**

First, let me start off by saying I appreciate anyone who responds to this post. Any advice would do wonders for me. I need information to decipher a clear path to success for the next 4- 5 months until Chicago. I'm running though a charity called Les Turner ALS foundation, and am excited to take on my first marathon.

**About Me**

I am 19, and have been running for exactly a year and a half. I started off not being able to keep a 8:00 minute pace then as time went on, without any training I managed to finish my first 5k in 20:19. This surprised me, as I had no training, and stuck to no plan. Ever since then I have run two more 5k's with my (PR) being 18:28. Now that PR took everything I had, at the end of the race I couldn't breathe well, and needed to see a doctor to help me get my breathing back to normal.


Since then I have plateaued, and peaked in many ways. I have now started tracking my MPW, and have noticed that I am getting up to 25-30 per week. This excites me because after my 10 mile run today, I felt no pain or soreness.
Moving on from here...

**Here are my questions:** Do you think this lack of soreness indicates that I am ready to potentially up my mileage gradually?
I ran those 10 miles I mentioned earlier today at a 7:00- 7:20 pace, and finished sometime under 1:15:00. My nutrition consist of fruit, lots of water, 2 Beet Root pills, one fat burner pill, and MORE WATER. That's before a run. Outside of that I am a vegetarian, and eat relatively well.


**Question 2** How do you think I will fare a Half-Marathon on 25-30 MPW?
I am gearing up for my 1st Half Marathon. I have run 13 miles before, but stopped twice for several minutes to refuel, I was running with a group, and not everyone paced the same. I kept a 7:30 pace throughout, but sped up to a 6:40 on the way back. I felt good after that run, but had some slight soreness in my calves.


**Question 3** This is the big one, what is the best path to success for a 3:10:00 marathon?


I can up my mileage to 40-50 MPW. This is doable, as my spring semester of college has ended. What do you do to train, I sometimes hear speed work doesn't work for everyone, nor does cross training. I simply lace my shoes up and run my believed marathon pace for most of my runs, sometimes slower if I feel soreness kicking in. I strength train a lot, I can still bench 225 for 3 reps. That's nothing compared to what I did in high school. I do push-ups, pull-ups, planks, bike, and I occasionally run on the treadmill with the incline on its highest setting to mimic hills. Speed work has always been a nuisance, as I hate the feeling of tiring quickly. Should I up the speed work?, or should I just keep long distance on my mind all the times.


**Question 4** Is a sub 3-hour Marathon possible with this body of work?

Being able to keep a 6:50-7:10 pace for a Half is VERY DOABLE for me in this current state I feel, how can I increase my odds of success, what would you recommend?


I know this is a lot, but I just hope for some answers or questions stemming from past experience, or just basic knowledge about the human body and it's ability to endure. Running is my life now, and I feel honored to be running this race for my father, who was diagnosed with ALS last year.

Today I'm writing to you because I need your advice to improve my training. I've done a lot of half marathon, but I don't like my time. Often, it's about 2 hours or more. After the runs, i'm not tired. I think I've a lot of endurance and mental strength, but I need to be faster to have the security to finish a marathon.

Today, I lift at the gym 3 time per week and play soccer in the weekend. So, I can add some workout of speed at the treadmill or something relative. I hope you can help me with your advice, my objective it's to done a marathon in less than 4 hours.

Hey all, I'd posted in advance of my book's release, but I also have a blog (http://maneatselephant.tumblr.com) that's my entire couch-to-marathon journey laid out.

In July 2013, I weighed 320 pounds and I'd never run more than a mile in my life. On a hot summer morning, I decided I wanted to run a marathon and I organized my entire life around doing it. I'd wanted to do my first full in 7 months, but I thought better of it and within a year and a half, I'd lost 100 pounds and gone from huffing and puffing around my block to running my first marathon (Rock 'N' Roll Arizona in 5:13:11).

I wanted to put together a book because I always wanted to build a guide for my pre-training self that spent days on end searching every blog on the internet for marathon advice. So, I wrote Man Eats Elephant as a conversation between my big pre-training self and my post-run self in the hopes others might be able to get something out of it in every aspect along the way from nothing to 26.2 miles.

It's available for Amazon Kindle, I hope it helps you out in some way! I've got a half-marathon slated for July 4th and I'm glad to be back in season.

I've been training for the Colorado Marathon since December, more or less following Hal Higdon's novice 2 plan. My goal is to cross the finish line, I'm not looking to break any land-speed records.

firstmarathon,"This was my first ever marathon. My first long distance race actually. I was a sprinter in my prime but primarily a hurdler.


**Background**

This time last year I was watching some friends running the London Marathon and I was extremely jealous. I had only just started trying to run for exercise and thought to myself I can do that! I didn't try to enter through the ballot, instead I gained entry through a small charity that luckily had some spots left. That wasn't until mid December that caused a bit of an issue. I was flying home to Australia for Christmas and holidays in Europe afterwards for a total of four weeks. I always take my running gear with me on holidays but jet lag, Christmas celebrations and the freezing cold in Europe kept me from starting my training.

**Training**

I didn't start training until the first week in February. I studied the various training plans on the London marathon website and decided to adopt the ""improver"" program as that was something I thought I could keep up with and slot in to month two of the program (month one was lost in January with all the travel).

I broke the golden rule of going too hard too soon with my training and in early April I suffered some debilitating pain in my knees. I decided to rest and strengthen rather than run. This meant that I missed my two final long runs so the longest I got through before the injury and race day was 18 miles. I squeezed 13 miles in one Sunday to test the knee and it held up quite well so I thought at least I would be able to start come race day.

**Race Day** 

Nice restful taper, carb loading and caffeine fasting in the days leading up to the big day. Woke up at 6AM, stomached some toast, banana with honey and a double espresso at the local Costa (my favourite local coffee shop wasn't open that early). I met my friend's sister who was also running and we made our way to the start. Kit bag dumped with the great volunteers and the world longest piss later I was in my starting area. When I applied I had estimated 5 hours finish time so I was right in the back. It took 19 minutes from the gun until I crossed the start line.

As this was my first marathon I didn't really know what to expect, or what time I should be going for. I kept umming and ahhing between 4:30 and 4:00. One of those online calculators told me I could probably do 4:06 given my fastest half marathon time (which was a Sunday long run). So I decided to just run as my body told me to run and see how it goes. 

**Start**

We shuffled to the start line. I was quite a way in front of the 4:30 pacer but couldn't see the 4:15 pacer in front of me. I figured If i can stay in between these two pacers I will get a time i'll be happy with so that was the plan! The first 8 miles were great. Legs felt good and most importantly so did the knees! I was hovering around a pace I knew would keep me between those two pacers. The most annoying thing was having to duck and dive around the sea of people. The crowds as you ran through Greenwich and past the Cutty Sark were great. Very moving, although the pace was anything but moving - It was quite the bottle neck. Once through there the road widened a bit and were weren't all jammed in like sardines. I had my first gel around then about the same time as I did on my practice runs.

**First 8 miles:** 1:15:19 

**Middle**

The middle 8 miles were steady. Taking the sharp right turn and being confronted with Tower Bridge  on mile 12 was emotional. My eyes welled up as I thought of my grandparents a day ahead of ANZAC day - the day Australians and New Zealanders take to mourn and celebrate their war dead. The adrenalin brewing from the crowds carried you over the bridge, my head was high and for a moment the legs, which were now starting to hurt felt like they were skating on ice. 

The euphoria soon ended as we started what I called the ""boring bit"" going through the Isle of Dogs and parts of East London that i've never visited. I turned my tunes up knocked back another gel and kept my pace going and then before I knew it I sighted the 4:15 pacer! I had caught up with him and so started doing the maths. I figured I must be going at a pace that would have me finish faster than 4:15 if I just kept up with him. The rest of this middle section was a grind. I kept my cadence up, fluids up and made sure to keep Mr pacer in my sight.

**Middle 8 miles** 1:16 ish  Total 2:31:16


**End**

The last 8 miles were no different. I kept my pace up and kept the pacer in my sight. I was now running with him but that proved quite frustrating as his pace was erratic. I would pass him and then a few minutes later he would come zooming by me so I decided to piss him off and follow my watch. If i keep ahead of a 9:45/mi pace I'd be OK. I was ticking the miles off and it wasn't until mile 21 when I had a mental switch up and knew the finish line was just a short 5 miler away! I kept my head and stuck to the plan to keep the same pace going. I kept my head up and was ticking off the landmarks while keeping an eye on my watch. I was picking off slower runners and walkers as I enjoyed the atmosphere, The Embankment, London Eye, Somerset house, Big Ben! The moment Westminster Palace came in to view I knew it was the home stretch. I turned the corner on to the Birdcage and picked the pace up. My legs hurt but not as bad as some poor souls, I felt good. Coming around in front of the Palace gave me another inspirational boost and I made the sprint to the end.

**Finish Time** 04:07:44

edit: according to the stats in the last 7.2km I passed 1559 people and I myself was passed by 24 people.

**lessons learned**

* I need to pay more respect to training and having a base. I expect If I keep the training up I will be able to make a nice improvement on this years time.
* Keep a cool head and a steady pace (duh)
* Enjoy it!

firstmarathon,"Hey everyone. I just registered for the Aspen Backcountry Marathon, which takes place on 8/13 of this year. I've run several half marathons (1:37 PR) and just yesterday ran my first 25K race (2:13 with 2000' elevation gain). I run about 30 miles weekly.

Yesterday I finished my [first marathon](http://imgur.com/FtT8Uuy) in 3:55'16"".

In order to motivate fellow first-timers, I will go in to as much detail as possible.


**Training**

I started running casually a couple of months before the actual training. This means a couple of times per week and a random amount of kilometers at whatever speed I felt like that day. It's only that I started following an [actual running schedule](http://imgur.com/fulIpwt) beginning of January (about 3.5 months before Marathon Day). To keep things easy, I label my runs in 4 categories: slow, normal, fast and constant. For me this translates into:
* slow: 6:00-5:30 min/km
* normal: 5:30-4:30 min/km
* fast: 4:30-4:00 min/km
* constant: 5:30-5:00 min/km

The ""constant"" running implicates no pauses or short breaks and trying to keep the exact pace as long as possible, whereas for the other runs I play with the speed and walk a minute when tired.


**Marathon Week**

The week of the marathon I only ran once. An easy run on Thursday. Normally I would have ran on Tuesday as well, but since I was playing squash that day, I didn't want to overdo it...

I can really advise you all to take it easy during marathon week. Since metabolic changes are highly unlikely here, especially because you have preparing your body for months now, it really doesn't matter that much if you run once, twice or even three times during marathon week. I would suggest you listen to your body. If you ""need"" to run, then do it. Just take it easy and don't run for a very long time.

I consumed a lot of carbs, especially two days before the marathon. I tried to limit the fibers as well so my body could really fill up with the necessary fuel needed to run this damn thing. Spaghetti, bread, salmon, that sort of thing.


**Marathon Day**

The marathon itself started on Sunday at 09:00 AM. This means I wanted to consume breakfast at 06:00 AM so my stomach could digest everything properly. I got up at 05:30 AM and ate some wheat bread with salmon, a banana and a sandwich with strawberry jam. I just drank tap water. No juices or anything.

Half an hour before the race started I consumed one last banana and drank a bottle of water, that's it.

The race itself is quite enjoyable for the first 20 kilometers. It's still OK for the next 10 kilometers. After 30 kilometers it's becoming hard. After 32 kilometers it's a struggle. When I reached km 35 it was painful. At km 37 the existential questions start popping up in my head. The last couple of kilometers I really started to wonder why people do this for fun. Are all of these runners masochists?

Interestingly enough, at km 40 I started feeling alive again and pushed my limits as far as possible to finally reach that 42.195 km mark. I even managed to sprint the last 100 meters.

When I arrived, I started crying. So many emotions, so overwhelming.


**Results and Statistics**

So, I did it under 4 hours (which was my secondary goal, after ""just finishing it""). Final result: 3:55'16"".

If you like numbers and statistics, keep reading, if you don't, scroll down until the end...

My watch tracked the time per kilometer. As you can see, It got worse towards the end...

The organisation of the marathon also tracked my time on several intervals:

* 21.097 km - 01:53:22
* 30 km - 02:40:47
* 42.195 km - 03:55:16

As you can see, the last part was the hardest.


**After the marathon**

Recovery is no joke.
A marathon is painful and you want to do everything to limit injuries and speed-up the recovery.
I used [this article](http://marathonleadership.org/running-coach-services/documents/MarathonRecoveryArticle_000.pdf) for my post-marathon advice. To sum up quickly for right after the marathon:

* keep moving after you cross the finish line, walking slowly is fine, just don't stop or even worse: sit down
* don't stretch right away
* eat and drink
* cold shower in stead of hot shower
* take a walk at the end of the day

Right after the marathon I had a burger and fries with a coke. It felt like a gift from the gods on that moment. No regrets!

If you have any questions or concerns, please let me know. If I can just help one of you, then I feel like it this post is worth it.

I might be alone as a guy who prefers to run in tights, but I think the extra support and warmth in my knees helps.

firstmarathon,"Hello all!

I've recently ran my first quarter marathon in 53 minutes. This isn't a stellar time, but it was my first time participating in a running event. I really loved the experience of the running event, everyone is in the same race and is competing against themselves. 

Being that I really loved the experience, I am thinking about participating in my first full marathon on the 16th of October. This is 183 days out from today. I've read through alot of articles and I've seen Hal Higdon's Novice 1 plan for the full marathon. And I think I could certainly invest the time and effort needed for the training. However, I am not an expert in marathoning, so I need your advice! Is this plan not too ambitous? 

Some information about my fitness level, weight, gender, etcetera: 

I've been running on and off for about two years, the past four months I've upped the game from recreational running to some serious training to at least run a sub 55 minutes on the quarter marathon. Furthermore, I visit the gym at least twice a week.

I have done more running than this, but since I started tracking I have ran 988.2 miles in 218 runs (avg pace 7:31). This tracking dates back to April of 2014. I usually try for weekly 10-12 mile runs and can usually stay at around 7:30ish pace depending on how I'm feeling.

I'm using [Higdon Novice 1](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51137/Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program) as a basis right now. Over the last month, I got back into the groove, and now I'm going to do the first 8 weeks of that (6 mile long run --&gt; half marathon). Those are all distances I've done before.

The question is, what should I do between that point (where I can comfortably run 13 miles, nice and easy), since there will be about 8 weeks of ""extra time."" I've read about ""building my aerobic base,"" and that seems like the appropriate thing to do, and it will also be good to have extra time there in case of injury. 

What mileage level should I work with during that 8 weeks? I was thinking basically stick to weeks 6-9 or so, but maybe it would be beneficial to get to a longer long run? I don't want to hurt myself from doing too many long runs too long--I'm guessing I just want to do weeks 13-18 *once*, leading up to the marathon, but what about the 15 or 16 mile long runs? Just do those weeks once as well?

I'm a college student with an appropriately messed up biorhythm so I don't get nearly enough sleep during the week, which means that running anything more than my standard 3x12k during the week and the weekend long run leaves me totally exhausted during my classes.

Just signed up for my first marathon. Scheduled on 7 August 2016. Today is 21 Mar 2016, which puts the race at just about 20 weeks.

firstmarathon,"Hi r/firstmarathon! I've been running for the last five years or so, starting with high school cross country and track and continuing with my university's running club during college, as well as doing a good number of half marathons. Now that I've graduated, I'm ready to go for a full marathon, but have been struggling to find the right plan for myself.  


**My background:** I'm 23 years old and am used to training at around 30-35 miles/week, 5 days a week, with mostly easy runs, 1 long (&gt;10 mi) run, and 1 fartlek or tempo included.  At this level, I have run four sub-1:25 half marathons.  During the summer/fall of 2014, I tried upping my mileage to ~40-45 miles/week, 6 days/week with an increase in speed work during my last year of club eligibility, but I ended up getting an achilles tendon injury that still occasionally flares up today.  I'm currently recovering from the last flare-up and am almost back to my normal 30-35 miles/week.  In the context of fellrnr.com's classification of prospective marathoners, I think I'd categorize myself overall as a [ringer](http://fellrnr.com/wiki/A_Comparison_of_Marathon_Training_Plans#Suitability_Comparison).  


**My Goals:**  I'm entered in the Chicago lottery and will sign up for the Twin Cities Marathon if that doesn't work out, both are October 9.  Considering my previous experience, I think that, if I can stick to the right plan and avoid injury, a 3 hour time is within reach. My time commitments over the summer (graduate student, will be in lab at weird hours) and past experience with injury are leading me to look for a plan that peaks at a 50-55 miles/week and calls for 5 days of running/week. Higdon's Intermediate 2 fits the bill for this, but it doesn't have any tempo work, which I would like to do.  From what I've read in other places, something like Jack Daniel's Plan A sounds appealing, but I haven't been able to find it online and, as a grad student, am not too keen to buy the book. Overall, are my goals reasonable? Any recommendations on a plan for me to use?

firstmarathon,"Running my first marathon on Sunday - and the one thing I hadn't trained for recently just happened.

Warm weather.

Ran a 7.5 mile slow jog on Saturday morning, at about 70 degrees F.    I eventually got used to it last summer, kinda sorta, but I'm not used to it right now.   We gained an extra hour of cool mornings with the time change, so hopefully that helps.  Forecast for Sunday (Atlanta GA) currently shows a high of 58 with a chance of rain, which I can dig (warm rain runs are the best!)    But I've never been too impressed with 6-day weather forecasts, so I'm not convinced - especially since yesterday morning the forecast for next Sunday was for 70 and dry.

So --  I went out and bought some ugly tank top in an effort to shed heat better.  (Which of course goes against the rules of not racing with something you haven't run a long run with, but I think I'll be OK on that.)   

Then, last night I had some stupid stress dream and slept like crap.

And of course my major form of stress release is *running*.   Particularly runs longer than an hour.  Which I'm not going to get to do this week, due to the tapering.    My other main forms of stress relief historically include eating too much ice cream, eating bricks of cheese, alcohol, and disc golf -- and the first 3 would just add even more insulation to my (hot) body, and I'm afraid of tweaking my knees or something stupid by getting out for a few rounds of disc golf at the park.

firstmarathon,"Hello everyone. Before I say anything else, I will admit that I lacked caution and was kind of dumb for running this marathon back in August.  

Last summer, I wouldn't have considered myself a runner. My fitness consisted of using weight machines and running a few miles on the treadmill at the gym a few times per week. I don't really eat healthy foods that often, but I am at a healthy weight. I think the event that convinced me to run the marathon was the fact that I finished a 15.5 mile trail run in June. 

Well, I was in over my head. The race was very flat and it was on concrete. I felt a stabbing pain coupled with muscle soreness around mile 18 or 19. I should have stopped there, but for some reason I hobbled to the finish line in 5:25. The soreness went away within a week, but I was limping for about 10 days with a sharp pain on my right side starting in my hip and going to my knee. It got slightly better each day. 

I haven't really ran much since then, although I did (somewhat idiotically I guess) complete a Tough Mudder nearly 4 weeks after the marathon. I only noticed slight aggravation after that run. To this day, my right hip/knee cracks more often than the left. If I do some running/jumping I'll notice an ache in my hip. I can still do everything I used to, but the cracks and slight pain are bothersome. I finally made an appointment with my PCP that's scheduled for next week. I'd just appreciate some input from some marathoners who might know what this is. My mind hasn't been at ease because of it. Thanks.

firstmarathon,"Hello runners or Reddit. First time post and I'll try and keep this as short as possible and definitely include a **TL;DR** *at the end.*

So I'll tell you my goals, my background, my questions/concerns, and then my plan of action as of now. Any help and insight will be much appreciated.



**Goals:**

*End goal-* run my first marathon this fall. Not sure which month, but I'm thinking either August or September. I live in the NE of the US and winter is my kryptonite.

*Immediate goal* - run consistently again. 4-5 days a week. Minimums of a 5k and maximum of 5 miles by mid March.



**Background:**

*High School* - I ran cross country and track all throughout high school. I was used to 5 runs a week plus a race on the weekend. My best 5k was 18:30, my best mile race was 5:40. My first 5k time was around 23:40 I believe. So I definitely had a good coach and if I didn't graduate I probably would have gotten better. And while it was never in an official race or practice I ran 3 unofficial half marathons before (just to see if I could. Best of the three was about a 2:20 run). About 5'9 and 140lbs when I graduated.

*College* - In college I barely did much physical activity outside of intramural floor hockey every spring, walking everywhere, and I did the Insanity program once. Graduated at 5'10 and 150lbs. 

*Now* - I graduated college in May of 2015. July of 2015 I started running regularly again. By November I was running about 25 miles a week (4, 5, 4, 5, 7). I pretty much left all of the first runs the same and increase the last day. I peaked at 10 miles, went into NYC the next day, got sick for 2.5 weeks and stopped running until last week.



**Questions/Concerns:**

* I don't like programs. I feel like they take the fun out of everything. ex. after completing Insanity the first time I got pretty good results. Tried the program again 1.5 years later and it felt more like work than something that I wanted to do and I never did it again. Even during high school I wasn't the biggest fan of running, was more into it because of the people doing it and I was pretty good at it. So I don't want to do a program, just run with a basic guide/benchmarks to reach. ex. 5k race in May, 13.1 race in June/July, 26.2 in August/September and taper two/three weeks before the race.

* I don't have anyone to train with. I like everything about this except that it makes it difficult to properly pace myself. Some days I can remember how hard I was generally running in HS and do a good job on my run and other days it seems more like I'm jogging after the first two miles than running. I guess for this I just need to know what type of run I plan on doing that day and stick to it?

* When I have done 13.1's in the past I usually finished pretty soar (back, legs, and around my elbows). I usually noticed this around the 10mi mark, but never when I would just run 10 mi. Should I have just been stepping up the miles slower, because in my mind a three mile jump shouldn't do that when you are in pretty good shape. One other thing to note is I never ingested anything on those runs (water, or energy).

* Should I focus on reducing my weight, or just naturally lose it while running? I know for the marathon the extra pounds (fat) would make a difference and I'm not sure if I should try to lose them as quickly as possible to maximize training? I feel like I have a good 3-5lbs that I could lose.

* I've been doing some weight/bodyweight fitness after my runs. Do you think that I should keep doing them at the end of my runs since running a marathon is my main objective, or do you think before my runs to get the most out of the workout and improve overall strength. Mix it up?

* Burn out. Every XC season I would get sick 2.5-3 month into the season. Just in time for Thanksgiving. Luckily break gave me a week off, but due to this I've added in easy weeks to my plan and will listen to my body a lot more than in HS. Good plan?

* I'm running a 5k in May. I'd like to run it sub 20:00, if possible. Should I even focus on my time since my goal is a marathon? I wouldn't be heart broken if I ran it under 24:00, but since I'm running this with friends I'd like bragging rights.



**Plan of action:**

* Run 4-5 days a week for the first month. Focus on distance at a slower pace for most of those days and on one day a week run 3-4 miles at a 5k pace. Last week will be an easy week. 

* Regiment more towards a 13.1 mindset the 2nd month. Run 4 days a week. 4mi hard, 6mi easy, 4mi hard, easy long run 1.5 hours. Last week will be an easy week.

* Run a 5k race beginning of May (already signed up). Continue running 4 days a week. 5, 7, 5, 1.5 hours.

* 4th month. 5, 8, 5, 2 hours. Last week will be an easy week.

* 5th month. Do a 13.1mi race. 

* 6th month. Start with an easy week. 5, 8, 5, 2.5 hours.

* 7th month. 5, 8, 5, 2.5 hours week one. Taper off 2-3 weeks. Run my first marathon and aim for four goals. One, Finish. Two, run the whole time. Three, have fun. Four, run it under 4 hours.



**TL;DR.** I want to run a marathon this fall, Sept. preferred. Ran XC throughout high school probably 30+mpw. Didn't run for 4 years. Started running 8 months ago with a 2 month break during winter. Not a fan of strict programs as they suck the fun out of activities for me. The section about this has my general plan. Any advice, insight, answers to my question/concern section? Anything at all will be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!

firstmarathon,"I'm a bit nervous about doing my first Marathon, because I recognize how serious of a commitment it is.  Before I decide to go through with a Marathon, I've got some questions I was hoping to have some of you vets answer!

1) Right now I'm 100% happy with my current weight and frame.  I'm 5'9"", 180 and am quite muscular, little fat, go to the gym usually every day and have a good mix of cardio and weight lifting (please don't take this as me being arrogant), I'm worried that if I start doing long intense runs I'll drop too much weight, probably touching into the high 160's due to muscle atrophy from all the cardio plus the muscle loss experienced from the time I won't be able to spend in the gym. 

 I'm most worried that I'll drop too much weight, and won't be able to return to my current state after the marathon is over.

2) I've done a half marathon with a pretty good time for my first race, 1:56:00, but my feet were absolutely destroyed after it.  Blisters everywhere, lost a toe nail etc.  I had trouble walking for the next week... you get the picture.  I would casually run ~6-10 miles a week before and never really started to train before the half marathon until about 3 weeks before where I stepped it up to a few 6-8 mile runs.  Last week I did a 10k, and my insoles blistered up, didn't slow me down too much, but had I gone further it would have been painful.  Before this one, I hadn't run since approx November.

Do these symptoms sound like a shoe problem?  Or should I focus more on easing my feet into the rigors of running?  

3)  My Dad did 2 marathons right at the 4 hour mark, so I believe I've got it in me to do the same.  What's the best training approach for aiming for the 4 hour mark.  I'm 23 years old, male.

I went away as planned and did my long run, 15km in the mountains. It took 3 hours 45 minutes, and quite a lot of it wasn't actually running. At one point I reached a sign that announced the next 200m were steep and dangerous and not to attempt them unless you were fully prepared.
I gave it a go, and they were not kidding! I had been warned but even so...! It took half an hour just to do those 200m! Then I stopped for a drink and a snack before coming down again. The next day I just went over a small pass on a wide tourist path. it was a great run.

This week has also not gone to plan. Yes, I got the odd shorter run in but have not managed the long run(which is a shorter one this week) due to stuff happening, mostly earthquakes but other stuff too, like my online college course, messing up my plans.

firstmarathon,"Just finished my first marathon, the LA Marathon. I had a great time all things considered and I learned a TON about running a marathon. I've run 4 half marathons but this was my first full and it was very different. Several people have written race reports over on /r/running so I'm not sure I have much to add except these things I learned. The quick and dirty is that my goals were: Sub 4 hours, 4:15, run the whole way, and just finish. I accomplished the last one and finished at 4:26.  
  
* Putting all your nutrition (gels or otherwise) in your pockets doesn't work. My pockets kept swinging back and forth once I got into rhythm and I had to carry a bunch of stuff until I used it.  
* Take only nutrition you LOVE. Taking a gel at mile 20 is a lot more unpleasant than taking one at mile 10. Also your motivation to chew anything at that point will be 0.  
* Your GPS will get progressively farther off the mile makers and this will be extremely disheartening. This was due, in my case, to lots of lateral movement. My GPS told me I ran 20 miles and it took another half mile to reach the mile 20 marker. I suggest pausing it and then resuming at the mile marker.  
* KEEP YOUR SHOULDERS RELAXED. Okay, I have been told this before but I forgot until late into the race. My shoulders are now more sore than my legs.   
* Have a mental plan for EVERY. SINGLE. MILE. I went into this race with a solid plan for the first 20 miles and thought ""well, there's only a 10k left"" for the rest. That didn't work and I was extremely discouraged by mile 20 and had to take walking breaks.  
* You know all those nice road closures you enjoyed while running? You're going to have to navigate around them to get home. Plan accordingly. I sat in traffic of over an hour just trying to get to freeway.  
  
I hope these are helpful!

firstmarathon,"I've been itching to finally commit to a full marathon but having a hard time planning it out.

* not currently following a plan, just working on a solid base and cross training. I'm at approx 23 mpw with a long run of 8.5 miles. Hoping to make that long one 10 miles next month. Cross training is strength.

* My short term goal is to get the half distance down. I've done three and had pain issues with all. my second was the best since the pain didn't make me walk. I have posterior tibial issues and had IT band issues in the past, hence the strength training. I want to sign up for a few halves this spring and summer to test the waters.

* My work schedule tends to get hectic in the summers and I work a lot of overtime, which could impact race training. My schedule usually goes back to regular full time in the fall. My current training routine still works when my work gets crazy.

* I want to do a large, well established race for my first full for the hype and course support. And a lot of those races have registration way in advance. 

* And how to pick a training plan?......

If I wait until this summer to see if I'm ready, should I shoot for a late winter or spring full? Fortunately I live in an area that has a ton of races all year (San Francisco Bay Area). The race I'm thinking of trying for is the international Big Sur marathon. I know it's a lottery so I'll be keeping an eye open for other major races around that time (April 2017).

firstmarathon,"Just wrapping up week 3 of novice 2 Hal plan. It's the first back down week, and I'm feeling a little de-trained. I started the week cross training a 5k, and pr'ing. Not exactly taking it easy, or doing something other than running. I should have approached the rest week a little different. I came into training with a pretty good level of fitness, and activity, having done a reasonable progression up to 13.1 before training officially began, with a rest week just before, then starting with a 8 mile, then 9 mile long run leading into this back down week. While I did want to sorta dip and start training with good rest and footing, I feel like the last three weeks have actually been a regression from where I was. Anyway, with the way I've felt this week (stomach bug) and the snow and frigid New England weather I'm thankful the schedule didn't push me this week. Getting out for todays 'long' 6m in 18* weather with high winds was not too bad, but if I had to go 10+ I'd have been less happy about the time outside. 
I wish I had done a better job with stretching, and cross training during this down week, to keep that level of activity up, but between feeling ill, snow days, and freezing temps, I did what I could. Still feel my ITB, core, and hips could use more flexibility and strenght. On the positive side, my new pair of shoes arrived and I can't wait to break em in. First run with them will be wednesday's 6m. The week ahead looks like.
s - 45 hr cross training (bike) + core / stretching, m - rest &amp; stretch, t - 3m  (stretch), w - 6m, th - 3m (stretch), f - rest, Sat - 11.

firstmarathon,"I've posted my background before, but long story short, I went from extremely out of shape in 2010, to a 3:14 marathoner in 2012, and now back to out of shape again. My last marathon was 2013, and I stopped after that and gained 50lbs, so I'm effectively a beginner at this point.

I'm 4 weeks into Hal Higdon novice 2. My last long run was 11 miles, and I'm scheduled to do 12 miles this weekend. I ran 3 yesterday, and my legs felt a little dead. Today I did 6, and it was ridiculously tough. I struggled through it and did the whole 6, but I didnt feel fresh at all. My right upper thigh felt slightly sore, and I just had no spring whatsoever. My legs still feel kind of sore, and completely lifeless.

It's been about 6 years since I was last in this stage of training, so I dont really remember what the best thing to do in this case is. I'm trying to lose weight, so I really want to keep running and persevere, but I dont want to injure myself. Are there any post run exercises I can do, or should I take a day off? I'd been feeling fine until this point, and confidence had been growing, but today felt like a real set back.

Update - ran 3 miles today and it felt easy. Maybe yesterday was just a bad day. Thanks for the advice anyone. I'm sure I'll be back asking for more before race day!

Update 2 - I delayed my 12 mile run by a day, so did it on Monday, and I'm skipping my 3 miles run on Tuesday, so will resume the plan on Wednesday. I think that helped, as I wouldn't say the 12 miles was 'easy', but it felt way easier than that 6 mile run from a few days before! My last run before that was on Thursday, so delaying by a day gave me 3 clear days off, which really helped.",4 weeks in and legs feeling dead
firstmarathon,"Good evening /r/FirstMarathon! 

Thanks to /u/meeeebo for reminding me that ""Write Race Report"" was still on my to-do list post race. Also, I may be a little long winded. So sorry in advance for the long post. I'm still pretty emotional about the experience, even a few weeks out. 

**Intro / Background**

A little over two years ago, I laced up my running shoes and did my first run. I still remember that first mile and how much I hated everything about it. I was sweating, I was panting, and I only did just over a mile before I started walking and found my way back home. But, more than anything, I was *angry*. Angry at myself and my body, angry I could barely even do a mile. ""I'm better than this"" I told myself, and I stuck with it. I still remember the overwhelming emotion when I finally did a 5K without stopping. Then it was a 10K, then I did something truly stupid and I got drunk in reach of a laptop and my credit card. Over the last swigs of a beer, I signed up for my first marathon in Houston. That was a fun hangover the next day, but it was time to get to work. 

**Training**

I followed [Hal Higdon's Novice 1](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51137/Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program) program, with a few modifications. First, I doubled a few weeks. I had some extra time and wanted to make sure that I was in a good spot for the race proper, so I turned 18 weeks into about 22 weeks and gave myself some extra time in the lower mileage weeks before I ramped up to 15+. Tried to keep as close to the 2 short-1 medium-1 long run schedule, but life happens. Stayed at an easy and comfortable pace, continually reminding myself that my goal is to finish, not to win or beat a certain time. I was comfortably maintaining an 11:45 - 12:30 pace. One month out, I was feeling pretty good. Even after finishing the 20 that I was so nervous about, I still felt pretty good. Time to fly to Houston and crush this thing! 

**The Race** 

Let me tell you: A 40 degree start temperature is *not. warm.*. It may SEEM warm when you've acclimated to the teens and low 20s of a Chicago winter, but it is not warm. I packed entirely wrong for the race, bringing along only a paid or compression shorts, thin Asic mid-calf running socks, and a humorous running T-Shirt. Oh well, not much I can do about that, and once the sun comes out I'll be fine. Also, I decided to go GPS-Free. No watch, no tracking apps, none of it. This will be important later as one of my biggest mistakes. I made it to the pre-race expo, check what little I had to check, and found my way to my corral to join all of the other insane people. I had my Gu gels, my music going, and I was ready to go. I'm a little proud to say this is the first time I've crossed a starting line and not teared up a little. 

**The Race - Mile 1 - 13.1**

Killing it. Absolutely killing it. The crowd, the other runners, the thrill of being in a different city doing something I love, even though I never dreamed in my wildest dreams I'd be a marathon runner. It was great. Stuck with my plan of alternating water every odd, Gatorade every even station, and took my first Gu at mile 7. Feeling great. Feeling better than I had in my other runs in training, which was starting to concern me. Either I had held myself back pretty severely in training, or I had screwed up somewhere in my pacing. Turned out it was the latter. I came out of the gate way, way, WAY too fast. Confirmed this after the race when I saw I set a personal record for half marathon... nearly 35 minutes better than my best training time. 

Crap. This is about to be an ordeal. I didn't realize this at the time, though. Still having a blast. It was around mile 12, though, that it started hitting me I had a lot more race left to run and started holding myself back. Too little, too late. 

**The Race - Half Marathon - Mile 15**

After crossing the half marathon checkpoint and doing some quick mental math, I realized my mistake. I started holding back, doing 4 minute runs, 2 minute walks. My first walk of the race. I fell in line with a group of runners who were doing a similar run/walk series and was still feeling pretty good. Nothing else really to note, just plugging along. Second Gu at mile 14.

**The Race - Mile 16 - 20, aka Attack of the Balloons**

Around mile 16 I started seeing these two runners with balloons strapped to their waists. Couldn't figure it out, thought maybe it was just some ""In case we get separated, find the other balloon person"" deal. I'd seen plenty of people running in costume in this and other races, no big deal. Balloon people are on a similar run/walk schedule as my crowd and I, so I think nothng of it. About mile 17, though, I look back and the balloon people are being followed by several police cars and a Greyhound bus. And they're a lot closer. About halfway through mile 19 I'm in a walking stretch and they catch up to me. I introduce myself, we chat for a minute during a walk, and I ask about the balloons, thinking it'll be a fun story or something. 

Nope. They're the 6 hour pace team, and I have to stay ahead of them to finish in time. At this point, I'm no longer feeling fine. Far from it. I'm starting to wonder why I'm doing this to myself. What was I thinking. Why didn't I just write this off as a drunken mistake and move on. Despite telling myself repeatedly to just finish, I had high hopes for myself. I wanted to do it in 5.5 hours or less. I wanted to beat my friends time. I wanted to show everyone who told me I was foolish that, no, THEY were foolish. Hearing that I was at--and being passed by--the 6 hour pacers crushed me. I fell behind and was passed by the pacers, the police, and the bus. 

**The Race - Mile 21 - 23**

I'm walking. I'm not the last person in the race, but I may as well be. I keep trying to run but I can't work up the energy. I shoot one of my Gu gels and down some more Gatorade at the next aid station, but at this point the aid stations are packing up. The crowds are gone. They're sweeping the streets. There's no one left to cheer for me, no one cares about the stragglers. I can still see the bus. I can see the balloons. I'm keeping up, but too far behind to matter it seems. 

And then some ignorant dick said some shit. I'm walking on the side of the road, a few people ahead and a few people behind me, and I overhear a conversation from the sidewalk:

**Man1:** So, the race is over, right? That's what the bus means?

**Man2:** Yeah, that's it. 

**Man1:** So, what about these people?

**Man2:** Ah, they ain't gonna finish. I thin there's another bus picking up the walkers.  

You ass. Who the hell are you to say I won't finish? Who. The HELL. Are YOU? Standing on the sidewalk drinking your damn coffee? I just finished 20 miles. To hell with you! **I'M BETTER THAN THIS.** 

The rest of mile 21 was spent in alternating 2 minute sprint/30 second walk. I caught up to the bus. I *passed* the bus. Slapped a few officers high fives as I passed their patrol cars, and fell in step with the pacers just in time for one of their walk breaks. Leave it to me to have to prove someone wrong. And then leave it to my body to ruin that, too. 

During a running period, just before the mile 23 marker, I was joking that all we had left was a 5k, when my foot landed very, very wrong. Sudden, sharp pain in my ankle. Pacers and Medical saw it immediately. I tried to play it off, but couldn't for long. Tried adjusting my foot strike, but nothing was helping. I'm officially done running for the day.  

**Mile 23 - Finish**

To say I'm disappointed in myself is an understatement. I'm hobbling down the street--Passed (again) by the pacers, the police, and the bus. Fighting back tears and trying to decide if it's worth it to finish, or if I can live with myself if I ask Medical for a ride back to the Expo. Even briefly considered hailing an Uber and going back to my hotel. Screw the stuff I checked at the Expo, I just want to go to my hotel and go to bed and sleep till my flight home the next day. 

I walked the rest, through the empty streets, trying not to cry when a police officer applauds or tells me I'm doing great. I lose it about 2 blocks from the finish line. I can see it... and I can see them tearing it down. I keep walking, I'm *going* to cross the damn finish line... and then a volunteer tells me I can't. Ushers me and a few other walkers off the street, through a crowd control barrier, and tells us the course is closed. No medal, no time, nothing. Go inside to collect your things from gear check before it closes. 

Another volunteer, I never got her name, saw us. She grabbed us and told us to follow her. She marched us inside the convention center. Anyone who told her she couldn't go a certain way she announced ""I have finishers who need medals and times."" That got us in. She made sure they scanned my bib to mark me as a Finisher. She made it her mission to make sure that I, and everyone who finished after me, got scanned and got our finisher shirts and medals. Even found us some bananas and chocolate milk. Never got an official time, but by my math I finished 6 hours 20 minutes. Nearly an hour over my ""goal"" time. 

It was an amazing experience overall. Took a week off to let my ankle heal, and currently in the middle of some low impact workouts to keep myself moving without risking further injury. Desperately itching to get back on the road, though, and to teach myself how to keep and feel out a pace without an app/GPS helping me, in case I want to go tech-free again. Next steps: Strengthen my ankles and knees and get back on the road, walking across the finish line is not an option next time!",[Race Report] - Houston Marathon

I've been looking at a training plan (the Hal Higdon Novice 2, to be precise) and I'm surprised to see it only goes to a long run of 20 miles prior to race day. Is this typical? My gut says 10k under seems like quite a jump. Nearly an extra hour of running to go on faith. Scary.

My long run last Wednesday was quite hard, and I had a sore knee afterwards but Thursday was a super hot day, so I went and sat in the sea, and after that my knee didn't hurt any more. Cold salt water is good for sore knees?

Saturday short run, went well, and I even remembered it was supposed to be easy. The pace run on Sunday however was a bust. Bonnie, my running companion, a standard poodle, cut her leg in the dunes at the beach. I was wearing a bandana so I tied her up with that and we limped home. Then off to the vet, and 4 stitches later she is fine, but won't be running again for at least a fortnight.

This morning I sneaked out through the bedroom so she wouldn't see me go! Ran a steady pace on the beach but kept stopping as the other dog walkers were asking where Bonnie was! So it took longer than expected...it did however keep it easy!

This week...week 17....I have to go away, so I am not quite sure what running I will be doing. I won't do the long run (15km) on Wednesday as I am travelling that day, but I have hopes for Thursday.

I started training for my first marathon early assuming that I would have to miss a few long runs due to injury or schedule issues but this was not the case.

firstmarathon,"I have been a casual runner for years. Within the passed 4 years, I have started doing competitive runs, starting with 5ks. I have completed 5ks, 3.5milers, 10ks, and 2 half marathons. And have now signed up for my first full.


I have done research on training plans as far as mpw, cross training, foam rolling, rest days etc. And I have been through most of reddit about others advice and experience on this. But I would like to delve further. Any advice on runs is absolutely welcome, but I also would like to know about diet, gear, and supplements;


Food:
My marathon is not until October, so I have plenty of time to build up my base before I start an actual training program. Every morning, training or not, I start my day with a protein smoothie. I don't like the way that whey feels in my stomach, so I use Vegasport Protein. While training for the half, I also used their hydrator and preworkout (only on extremely necessary days). Overall, I eat pretty healthy, and I know when training that a carbs:protein balance is important. But I would like to know more specifically, what were your meals like leading up to race day. Did you stick with the same meal plan all throughout your training? What specific foods did you find vital?


In-race Fuel:
I have never been on a long enough run to need energy gels or salt tablets or anything, so any introductory advice on how to use these is crucial. I sweat ALOT even on short runs. Should I take a salt tablet before? How often during my marathon should I use GU?


Shoes:
I have 133+ miles on my shoes now. My feet are sensitive and I am an overpronator- usually around 300-350 miles or so, my feet can no longer handle my shoes. I'm thinking I will need a new pair by the time the race comes around. I know this varies by person, (some people can handle over 500 miles per shoe) but how many miles do you usually put on a pair of shoes before race day?

I know I had specific questions, but any info at all is welcome. I'm somewhat of Type A and want to be as prepared as possible come raceday. Thanks in advance :)",Marathon Advice (for the big picture outside of run training)
firstmarathon,"Hey, how's it going. Quick backstory: I've been running for maybe up to five years, but only really regularly/with focussed training for the past year or two. Last summer I made the mistake of jumping into one of Jack Daniels' 5-10k plans (great training programmes, way too high mileage for where I was at when I started) and ended up with leg pain that plagued me for the rest of the year. Most recent timed event was a half marathon in 1h53, but it was on very little training and quite erratic when I was. Even then, I felt like I had a fair bit left in the tank at the finish. Longest run I've ever done is about 28km. After a couple of trips to the physio I think I'm back on top of the leg pain now, so I'm looking to start training for my first marathon. I signed up for the first incarnation of the modern Morpeth 2 Newcastle marathon, and put my target time as 3h15-3h45.

Given the available time (about 24 weeks) I'd realistically hope to be somewhere in the higher end of that range, but for training I'm trying not to make the same mistake twice and aiming to build up slowly. To that end, I've come up with a rough programme based around Higdon's Novice 1 plan, stretched from 18 to 24 weeks and mushed from 3 week cycles into 4 week cycles. Doubtless I'll end up changing things on the fly, moving things around in the week, not sticking exactly to the allocated miles but I guess what I'm wondering is, does anyone see any major problems with this and do you think it'll actually work? The basics of the plan are:

**MON:** rest day, with some stretches, foam rolling, yoga, maybe a trip to the pool, skipping, whatever feels right

**TUE:** 30-50 minute easy run

**WED:** some kind of interval session, taken from the Daniels book but adapted to the weekly mileage

**THU:** repeat of tuesday

**FRI:** rest day

**SAT:** long run

**SUN:** bike ride longer than 1 hour

Extra cross training wise, try to make it to the pool and have turbo trainer session at least once per week. [Here's all the juicy numbers](http://i.imgur.com/ciwOOyj.png). Thanks a lot for any help :)",Could someone take a quick look at my plan?
firstmarathon,"This week is the official start of training using Hal Higdon Novice 2. It is Monday morning and really a rest day but I have had to muddle the days up as my long run will have to be on Wednesday for the first half of the training.

So Saturday I did 7km hills. I did a new best time for this particular run, and also a new best time for the final climb. It is quite short, about 1 km, but very steep, keeps breaking into steps. It is also rough and some steps have been washed away a bit making them a huge stride up! 
Sunday was a rest day and today I did easy 5km on the beach. Tide was out so nice hard sand, sun rising out of the sea :) I took 40 minutes including picking up doggy do and picking up and throwing shells all the time for my training partner. 

Tomorrow a rest day, Wednesday, 13km hills, Sat 5km, Sun 8km, mon 5km.
I have to do hills for my long runs as my 'half marathon' on week 9 is actually a 17km hill race. Hubby, a real runner, is doing the mountain marathon, and as I am there anyway, I shall run the 17km, there is also a 10km, but I think I shall do the 17. The 10 km is undulating, but the 17 goes the same way up the hill as the MM, but then contours round and back down whilst the MM people go over the back.
If you want to know what it is like, it is the range to the north of Rohan in the Lord of the Rings movies.

firstmarathon,"I've decided to work towards running my first marathon.  My desire to do this comes from a reaction to a feeling of dissatisfaction with life coupled with the nagging suspicion I can achieve more than I've let myself believe I'm capable of.  When faced with challenge it's easy to get stuck in a pattern of avoidance.  Rather than resulting in a more pleasant, less troubled existence, the avoidance leads to even greater discomfort.  It's as if life requires we experience a predetermined amount of pain, the avoidance of which compounds it.  

I hope that accomplishing something I feel incapable of, uninterested in and unlikely to achieve will transform my affect and outlook on life.  After all I realize these feeling of impotence, disinterest and self-doubt are only reactions to being faced with something extremely challenging.  This tendency to avoid difficulty has through habituation ingrained itself into my life, leading to feelings of disinterest and self-doubt whenever a challenge presents itself.

The marathon is run from the University I attend, and so I hope to do a lot of training before I go home for summer so they don't get suspicious of what I am training for. 

I want to keep it a secret for two reasons: (1) so I can start the training without having to hear them weigh in constantly, possibly with over-ambitious thoughts or maybe with thoughts that I can't do it and (2) because it would be nice to have that big reveal! I am really excited and hopeful and look forward to running it!

firstmarathon,"As I was jogging today I saw an eagle. Wings spread wide, soaring high, the wind beneath him, the blue sky above him. He was in his moment. He was meant to soar. He was awe inspiring.

My thoughts turned inward and I realized that as my arms swung, my heart was soaring high. The wind blew against my face and I was happy. The blue sky above soothed my mind. I was in my moment. I was meant to run.

My thoughts turned outward and I realized that other runners inspire me. I see them and I think ""I wonder how far they are running today"" or ""isn't it great to be running"" or ""look, they are running and I am running too"". We are in our moment.

Then, my thoughts turned to the running documentaries that I've watched. The one named ""Marathon"" and the one about the ultra marathoners running through the desert. I thought about seeing glimpses of marathoners in the news crossing the finish line. They are in their moment... and it shows.

Then I thought about /r/firstmarathon. All of those nice marathoners that are willing to talk to those of us who have never run one before... but want to. Yes, we really want to... and we appreciate the advice. YOU inspire us. YOU are awe inspiring. YOU give us the inspiration and drive to continue pushing through and to know that it is possible. You are in your moment.

I wanted to run and run for hours, just like all the marathoners I've seen on TV and read about on /r/firstmarathon.

#Intro

Back in June, before my 31st birthday, I decided to run a marathon before the year was over. Mainly because I meant to do it when I turned 30 but never did. So, better late than never.

I lived in Philly for three years, before moving up to NYC. I loved living in Center City, I heard the marathon was well run and not too hilly, and the race fit in with my training schedule, so I decided to let the city of brotherly love have my first marathon. The race was really well organized, or seemed like it at least. My only other experience was the Brooklyn Rock'n'Roll half, which was okay but was a real clusterfuck at the beginning. They seriously had like 12 portable toilets for all the corrals, i.e. 1000+ people per. Philly, in comparison, was a well-oiled logistical machine. Or it just had more toilets and that's all I really cared about.

This race report ended up being longer than expected...decided to just brain dump, sorry!


#Training

* Started running seriously at the end of June 2015. Meaning, training schedule and obsessive running reading and all that. Not unfamiliar with running, but before this summer I usually kept it to 2-3 miles or &lt;30min, and would often go months without any exercise at all.
* **Plan** I used [Higdon's Novice 1](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51137/Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program) plan, modified a little. Stuck to four days a week, and peaked at 40MPW. [Strava graph](http://i.imgur.com/2064lbH.png).
    * There were two weeks where I did zero/almost zero running because of almost-injuries. Patellar knee pain was the cause of one week (turned out to just be tight quadriceps, stretching silver bulleted the pain) and weird tendonitis-type feelings when flexing my right side pinky toe (turned out to be too tight shoes during a half-marathon). 
    * I also added an extra 21 mile run.
* **Effort**
    * All my runs were just done at an easy-ish pace, decided to just focus on completion. I live in New York City, and do most of my runs in Central Park and nearby parks, which made for lots of loops and some okay hills.
    * There were a number of weeks where my long run was well over 50% of my weekly mileage. To make sure I didn't stress my body too much I'd generally run around the shore of Manhattan, which is super flat.
    * There was a period where I tried run-streaking (just a slow mile on a treadmill on rest days), but I don't think my body was ready for that, I think I needed the rest days.
    * If I had to do it over again, I'd have started training at the same time, but signed up for a marathon in Fall of 2016 instead. There were too many times where I could feel myself approaching injury and spent the resulting rest days worrying I was ruining my training schedule.
* **Weight** In August I read [Racing Weight](http://www.amazon.com/Racing-Weight-Lean-Peak-Performance/dp/1934030996) and, combined with running, it inspired a transformed diet and consistent weight loss. I'm short, 5'4'', and was a wrestler in high school (140 or 145 weight class) then mainly just lifted in college and afterward. For the last decade (I'm 31) my weight has always fluctuated between 155-170. Currently at 142.5 and still falling. [Trend weight](https://trendweight.com/u/190e15e703c34c/).


#Fueling

* Drank water at all but maybe two water stops. Had a packet of Honey Stingers at 0:30, 1:30, 2:30. Had originally planned on doing one at 3:30 but I was close enough to the end that I didn't want to bother focusing on eating and drank water stop gatorade instead.
* Was pretty good with rest and carbo-loading the final week of taper. One mistake was going to a Thai restaurant the night before. I normally love spicy food, though since running I only eat spicy if I know I have a full rest day until my next one. But I thought I'd be okay if I didn't eat anything spicy. Instead I ordered a garlic chicken dish (face palm), which was fantastic but had way more garlic than I expected. I ended up waking up with slight stomach discomfort, but after a bagel breakfast and water it went away, and never came back.


#Race Strategy

* I planned on following the advice in [this article](http://www.runnersworld.com/ask-coach-jenny/how-to-pace-your-first-half-or-full-marathon).
* **Pacing** 
    * When I signed up for the marathon months ago I'd guesstimated a 5:00h marathon. But, my last two 20 mile runs ended up being between 9:10 and 9:20 mi/min paces, so I decided I should move up to a faster corral.
    * My initial plan was to run with the 4:30 pace group (~9:45 pace), then go at my own pace halfway through.
    * The day before the expo I decided I was being too conservative and decided to just try and run through the entire marathon with the 4:00 pace group (~9:10 pace). That would be less conservative but still not wishful thinking.
    * I ended up sticking with the 4:00 pace group until mile 11 and then risked having enough energy and just started running at my own pace.
* **Pre-race**
    * I must have a small bladder, because I've had to stop for the bathroom on my 18+ long runs, and during my first half-marathon I also had to stop to use a port-o-john. So this time I didn't overdo it with water the day before, and then before the race started I basically used the porta potty three times, pretty much anytime I had the merest inkling that I might want to go. It worked, never had to stop during the race.
    * I should have brought more clothes to stay warm at the beginning. It wasn't too cold, it was almost 50 fahrenheit, but it was pretty windy and in the dark it was uncomfortably cold.
    * I also should have worn normal socks then switched to my racing socks. After waiting around for an hour and a half (I may have gotten there a little early), my racing socks felt a little soggy. But they didn't end up giving me any trouble.

#The Race

##(Miles 1-11) Playing Catch the Pace Group

I'd been planning on sticking with the 4:00 pace group. While in the corral I thought, *""as long as I can see the balloon I should be okay for the start.""* Wrong. So wrong. The race starts and the pace group pulls way out in front. Soon they're out of sight and I'm threading the needle trying to catch up with them.

It basically took me until we'd crossed Center City to the Delaware River (~2 miles) to catch up to them. And then it was a full time job dodging runners and trying to keep up. That was kind of interesting in itself, but even if I stayed directly behind the pacers, I'd still get left behind if one of them dodged through a gap that suddenly got plugged. At one point back across Center City the street got narrower and the balloon surged ahead almost out of sight again. After crossing the Schuylkill River and getting into University City, the racers thinned out a little bit and it was easier to stick with the pacers. I started running in front of them but keeping pace, because there was slightly more room ahead of the 4:00 ""wave front"".

At one of the water stops I did make a novice mistake and dodge too quickly to one side and slow down to grab a water, without looking out to see if anyone was behind me. Felt pretty bad for the people I cut off but made sure to be careful the rest of the race.

I think this section had two longish hills. I dunno, I actually like hills (still learning to run really fast downhill, though), and none of the hills in this race seemed that bad to me.

At roughly mile 11, I looked back and realized that the pace group was now a lot further behind me. Dodging through the runners and running naturally had just gotten me this far. I wondered if I should slow down and let the pace group catch up until the halfway point so I don't expend too much energy, but then I just decided to go for it.


##(Miles 11-21) Adios Half-Marathoners and Counting Down the Miles and Distractions

Miles 11 and 12 passed pretty fast, maybe because it still wasn't half-marathon distance. After the half-marathoners were jettisoned from the course and I passed the 13.1 marker, that's when my head started thinking *""Okay this isn't just another run, this is for real a marathon.""*

Running with the pace group, the miles had really flown by, I'd even missed a lot of mile markers. But now there were a lot fewer runners and a little bit more fatigue so I started thinking about how many miles were left in the race at each mile marker.

I think that races are great because there are a lot of random distractions that take your mind off how your body is feeling. Like:

* There were more ""that's what she said"" signs than I expected there would be.
* I loved when the runners cheered the elite front runners running past the opposite way, finishing their 24th mile just as we were passing the first miles of our second half.
* Big fan of drums on the race course, especially live ones. There were some taiko drums (maybe? I didn't catch what kind) by the Philly Zoo and a drum kit out toward Manayunk that I really liked, I wish there were more.
* I felt the music was kind of hit or miss at the cheer zones. Nice cross-section of music I guess, but when there were songs I liked I really did feel more motivated. I don't run with music, and sometimes I think I'm missing out.
* There was a ""Higdon Lied"" sign nailed to a telephone pole. It made me chuckle.
* There was an unofficial beer station up in Manayunk, I decided to err on the safe side and decline this time around, haha.
* I wasn't blazing past people, but I was steadily passing them all through these sections, that was a really nice feeling and it kept the turnover of people/outfits going pretty well. I wasn't willing to do the math to actually pace myself (I never really do it on my own) and I don't have a GPS watch, so I was just going by feel. It was cool having a handful of runners who would sometimes be in front of me, sometimes be behind me.
* Listening to other runner's conversations was interesting. I counted at least two Santas (one fast, one slow), a Poseidon, and a Captain America. There were definitely more but those stood out in my memory.
* I really appreciate all the cheering when I'm running, especially when people yelled my name out (on the bib). But I wouldn't acknowledge any cheers because it took energy, which I felt a little bad about at first.
* At mile ~23ish there was a joggler/dribbler (two balls and a basketball) coming down the other way. Pretty impressive pattern.

Mentally, I never did too much mantra repeating (I seem to do that more during training runs), only really around mile 16-17, but I stopped because I didn't feel like I needed it. Reaching the turnaround in Manayunk (the last ~6 miles were basically back the way you came) was a really great feeling, especially because the crowds were livelier too. After the turnaround I got really into the zone for about a mile. Not thinking about anything, running a little stronger, and it felt like I was staring ahead of me farther and without wavering, if that makes any sense. My breath felt different. It happened again toward the end of the race.


##(Miles 21-26.2) Terra Incognita

My longest training run was 21 miles. So everything after this point in the race was unknown for me. I never hit the wall, which was nice, so I think my pre-race rest/carbo-loading and my gummies were done well.

Some of these last few miles actually passed the fastest in my head. I continued to count the miles down, but now I started associating the distances with my usual runs in Central Park. 4 miles left? *That's just a run around the reservoir plus there and back.* 3 miles? *That's just a run up to the reservoir and back.* 2 miles? *That's just up and down Harlem hill crossing the 102nd transverse. I did it Thursday, it felt so easy!*

It wasn't until partway through mile 25 that a little voice started nagging me that it might be comfortable to just walk for a little. I think I entertained the thought for a bit, but then my head just said, *""It's a little too late in the race for this, might as well keep going.""* Also, at the last water station the volunteer handing me the water read my name off my bib and told me there was only a mile and a half to go. I'm pretty grateful to him, it was incredibly motivating.

That first marathon strategy article I linked above suggested going conservative for the first half, fishing and pushing until 24, then going all out. I definitely did not have enough energy to go all out the last 2 miles, haha. The crowds at the end and the thought of finishing were all that keeping me going. I didn't start ""sprinting"", if you could call it that, until about mile 26. My wife said I showed up well before the estimated finish time and had already passed her by the time she got her phone out to take a video.

One moment I sort of regret was that after I picked up speed at the end a guy right in front of me grabbed his hamstring and went dead stop. I thought about stopping and asking if he was alright, but instead decided to just run by. Feel a little guilty about that.


#El fin

The Philly marathon was great. Crossing that finish line felt incredible. You go from run to stop to light-headed flying up in the air. It was really a sublime feeling, I still smile thinking about it. I don't have a lot of experience to go on, but I thought the crowd turnout was pretty good for the day (mostly cloudy, chilly). [The medal was awesome](https://www.instagram.com/p/-ZrAWZiL88/). It was really great hearing the crowd of spent marathoners shambling around with bells dingling. 

My next step in training is a reverse taper for two weeks, then spending the winter doing Daniels' Blue fitness plan, then the spring/summer/fall start doing one of the longer marathon training plans, and then I'm thinking the Hartford Marathon for my next. Also doing NYRR's 9+1 for NYC 2017.

firstmarathon,"I've been trying to post on here to keep updates on my first marathon training, and thought that this would be the best time to mention that I just finished the Tulsa Route 66 Marathon in 4:09:42! It was incredibly tough, the hills and gusts of wind did not help. But I found a way to keep on the slow jog whenever things got tough. 

Around mile 15 or 16 there was a huge incline that went for around half a mile, and that is when I fell back from the 3:45 pace group. After that, I was essentially in limbo, as I typically feed off of other people's pace. Around mile 22 I saw the 4:00 pace group pass me by, which wasn't really a good sign (I really wanted to break 4 hours on my first try, but fell short). 

The rest of the marathon was a bit of a struggle as there were constant inclines, including one ferocious hill leading up to the very end of the race. I'm just really glad that I finished and didn't have any injury. Next time, I'll try a city without so many hills and hopefully break the 4:00 mark!",Finished my first full marathon!

Your input is appreciated. ",Questions concerning the practicality of my training program
firstmarathon,"I will post my thoughts here for anyone who may find them useful. Last weekend, I completed my first road marathon, the Chickamauga Battlefield Marathon.

Base: I will begin by defining the sort of base fitness I was training from. I have run gradually more miles over the past three years, with no general focus other than enjoying myself in trail races, and staying off the road as much as possible. Over the past 3 years, I have run 500, 500, 600 miles, and this year, so far 1200 miles) At least half of these miles are on technical trail.

Training: I chose to build a custom plan for myself, based on the “Run Faster from the 5K to the Marathon: How to Be Your Own Best Coach” adaptive training philosophy. Each weeks “important” workouts (intervals, tempos, longs) were all taken from the sample Marathon plan, but I did have to make major modifications to the plan, based on my signing up for the Barkley Fall Classic “50k” right in the middle of the training cycle. [See my much more entertaining than this post Barkley Fall Classic 50k race report](http://mdubruns.blogspot.com/2015/09/2015-barkley-fall-classic-race-report.html). If you care to see it,  [my personal hand written training plan](http://imgur.com/a/3xt0a). Legend for that would be: Digits would be miles, “m” = minutes, “LL” = long lunch where I go for approximately 2 hour run.

Weekly Mileage: (this may or may not mean much, based on how much trail time I do. Most of the weeks that are down in mileage are likely high in elevation gain)

Experience: While this was my first road marathon, I have completed multiple difficult trail races which were longer than 3 hours, so I knew I had a good deal of experience with similar levels of suffering.

Race: I went into the race with an A goal of 3:30, B goal of 3:45. I didn’t have the best idea of what my marathon pace is/was before the race, as most of my running is based on effort because I am first and foremost a trail runner. I had a feeling it was somewhere around 8:00, but anything faster was a gamble. The point of even running a road marathon is to get the experience for future years, where I “think” I want to attempt to BQ once I move into an easier qualifying bracket, based on age. So completing the marathon, for me, was a given. The challenge was to find how fast I could do it without blowing up. I believe I came real close to finding that out. Before the race, I met with the 3:40 pacer, and determined that all the pacers were instructed to run even splits, even though the race did have some hills to it. I decided my race strategy would be to stick to the 3:40 guy, if things felt easy to speed up a bit, but not until at least 13.1 miles in. When the race started, I positioned myself in front of the 3:40 guy, and stayed close. This pace was way too easy for me, but what I didn’t know was what it would feel like after 20 miles like this. It really was a gamble. At about 3 miles in, the 3:30 pacer was still so close, that I decided to roll the dice and roll up to him, and stick with him. So I cruised with the 3:30 group, and everything felt fine, and happily easy. At times, I felt like I could easily push the pace a bit more, but reminded myself that I was already running with my A goal and decided I would never pass this guy, unless for some incredible reason I felt great in the last 3 miles of the race. We passed 13.1 right on the money for the 1:44:xx split. Somewhere around mile 14, the pacer looked at his watch and said “why was that one slow?”, which didn’t make sense to me, because we never changed our pace, AND we came through 13.1 RIGHT on time. Nevertheless, he sped up at least :10 per mile from that point on. So far, I had been walking through every aid station casually drinking, then catching up to the pace group within a 1000 yards or so. But, since he sped up, I could never quite catch him again after walking through aid stations. At mile 20, I resolved to push harder and try “one last time” to catch him, thinking if I could only be right behind him, it would be easier to do some mindless following while he kept the pace. For some reason though, he just kept the hammer down. I’ll never know why. I could NOT catch him. As I was trying to push and catch him, I was about 100 yards back, I knew he was within reach. I could hear someone behind me breathing real hard doing their best to follow me as well. The guy comes up next to me and says “LETS GO. You are pulling along a 66 year old man here! We gotta catch that pacer!” DAMN. This guy was so strong. I informed him I was half his age, and that I was trying to catch the pacer as well. The 66 year old had plenty of fight left in his tank, but I did not. Looking back, this was my chance to man up or shrink back. That day, unfortunately, I didn’t man up. I told the 66 year old beast he had to go alone. At this point, I knew I couldn’t sustain an 8:00 pace anymore, and resolved to run the remainder by effort. I had already ran the majority of the race at my A goal, and if I could just run it in, even at a much slower pace, I could still beat my B goal easily. This was a win, and I didn’t have to suffer for it. So, the remainder of my race was a mix of running by effort, with a few extra walk breaks. I suppose I “hit the wall”, but I have experienced this level of exhaustion, and even deeper. I know that if I adjust my effort appropriately, I can easily keep going for hours. I believe what I experienced is a lack of race specific training, and I know where I can improve now.

firstmarathon,"I'm running the London Marathon in April, i've started the Higdon Novice 1 training plan and all is going well. It seems like it's gonna do the job in terms of getting the miles under my belt but the problem is i'm already on week 5 and i'll reach the peak of the plan about 5 weeks early (I didn't fancy waiting to start training simply because a plan didn't fit the schedule). I'm reluctant to repeat any weeks just yet as I need to get a higher weekly mileage first, what would be the best way to extend the plan? Which weeks might be good to repeat or alter?

Thanks!",Need some training plan help!
firstmarathon,"Hi,

I’ve been ‘jogging’ for about ten years now, on and off, but I wouldn’t call myself a serious runner – I’ve always preferred to lift/ swim as well, rather than focus purely on running, and I found 10k my preferred distance for running; I’ve never gone further than ten miles and the only races I’ve done have been 5k's and various mud runs. 

I’ve also struggled with injuries lately - knee issues five years ago, plantar fasciitis on and off for 2-3 years now (currently ok but fearful of it returning) and I broke my foot back in May this year which obviously led to no running, weight gain and a remarkable loss of fitness.

I got into the London Marathon this year though, having applied for the last six years without success! It’s been an event I’ve grown up watching and have always loved the idea of running it, despite the fact that 26 miles is well out of my comfort zone!  

I’m incredibly excited but also totally overwhelmed by the different training plans – so any advice as to what would suit me would be appreciated.

I’m back up to running ~10 miles a week at the moment (traditionally what I’ve aimed for), and I know that needs to be considerably increased.  

I ran a 10k@52m and a 5k@23m  last month, not my fastest but given I was struggling with 10 minute miles when I started running again 3 months ago (post-break) I’m pretty pleased with those. Longest recent run was 8 miles@9.16min/m.

The start is on April 24th so I have a while,  but at the same time the more I read, the more I feel like I could use another 12 months to slowly ramp up my weekly mileage! 

The ‘safest’ option seems to be Hal Higdon’s Novice 2, which I’d have to start in December and would be a very slow ramp up with one long run and a few short runs a week – pretty much what I’ve always done.

I’d really like to break 4 hours however, and a lot of criticism of this plan seems to be that it while it will get you to the start line injury free, and able to go the distance, it won’t get you a very good time.

I’ve got a HRM but I’ve read conflicting things about training to your HR.

Can I manage sub 4 hours with this plan or, given my starting situation, is sub 4 hours too much to aim for without injuring myself?  If it’s not too much then is there a better plan to achieve my goal?

Tldr: Running 10 miles a week at the moment after injury. Marathon is in 5 months, can Hal  Higdon’s Novice 2 get me across the finish line injury free in under 4 hours, or am I over reaching?

firstmarathon,"I'm a huge fan of this subreddit, and I have posted here a few times before. My first marathon is coming up on Nov. 22nd, in Tulsa, OK. I have been training for the past 6 months for this day, and now my right ankle is hurting like crazy... 

I have stopped running altogether for the past 2 weeks (since this inflammation has happened), and I am beginning to come restless and nervous about my race. I know that I have done well in my training up until this happened, but I can't shake this feeling.

The day after I ran 20 miles (the peak of my training schedule), my right ankle became very sore. I think it is tendonitis, but can't say for sure. It has been an issue that I thought would resolve itself, but still ongoing. I bought an ankle sleeve, and have been rubbing icy hot on it every day for the past 2 weeks. My ankle is slowly starting to feel better, but I don't know what I should do in regards to training now. I don't want to injure it again if I try getting some miles in before, but I also don't want the next time I run to be raceday.

firstmarathon,"So I have been training on a beginner's marathon program using Nike +. I like it because it has all my runs set out for me and I can keep track of my paces and distances and progress. I have never been much of a runner but I am a long distance cyclist and also ran a 10-k in summer 2014. Since this spring, I have been gradually ramping up my running and started the 41.195 training program at the end of September. The race is March 13th. My goal is basically 6 hours and no major injuries. when I started I had some pains in my right knee, which was caused by high arches and insufficient support. That was easily fixed by custom insoles and now I have no pains. However, on Tuesday November 3rd (1-2 weeks after I got my insoles) I started to get pains in my left shin. It happened on [this 9.7 km run](https://www.strava.com/activities/425729656) where I was to do intervals. I've done a few 9.7s and a 10 on this training program before, and there were no hills on the course, but after it hurt quite a bit so I skipped the next day run and went for a run on Friday. I was pretty much limping then. On Saturday I went for a 90 km bike ride then taped my shin and ran 11 km with a lot less pain than Friday. However, on Monday I couldn't run and have skipped every run since. 

Yesterday I went to the doctor and was diagnosed with ""a risk for stress fracture."" I'm not sure but this sounds worse than shin splints. I have an MRI scheduled for next week. He said the bone on one side is thicker. I'm not sure why that is bad, but I'll take his word for it. He said I need to do training with less impact such as running on grass or running in the water. He said I can do weight training too.

I was wondering if anyone has had this problem... at risk for stress fracture in your first marathon, and did you run the marathon? Is there any way I can avoid getting a stress fracture, and continue to train sufficiently for this? ",Week 7/24 of my first marathon training: Doctor said I'm at risk for a stress fracture.
firstmarathon,"So a little bit about me. I'm in my mid twenties and have just completed my first year of dedicated long distance running. I first started running in high school as a track and field runner (400m and polevault). After high school I transitioned into weightlifting all the way until last year where I had experimented with road biking and then settled into long distance running. So far I have raced 2 Half Marathons and 1 10 miler. During the training phases I've ran 1 run in half marathon distance and my furthest run was a 15 miler. My regular long runs (weekly or biweekly) are 10 miles. My weekly mileage during the 3-4 months before a race were around 20-35 miles. And my fastest half marathon time is 1:41:46. I've considered putting off training for a full but my latest race boosted my confidence and am now considering it. The time frame to train for this would be around 1 year, with the hope to run the Philadelphia Marathon November 2016. My training plan in the winter is to base build from a regular of 30-35 to a 45-50 mpw. Also, I'd potentially focus on diet to work my weight down from 155 to around 145. Any thoughts on this? I have heard that newer runners should hold off on the full marathon until they have several halves under their belt (5-10).

firstmarathon,"Hi, I do high school cross country and to get better at running I heard you have to go further so I was thinking doing a marathon training plan but that would be dumb to train for a marathon and go for really long runs and not actually do a marathon. So, I am a freshman right now (14) and I was thinking of doing a marathon or a half marathon after this year depending on how my heels feel because I have heel problems. I would be 15, so would 15 be too young to run a half/full marathon?

Just a little last question. How do you find out the right pace for a marathon? My 5k time is 21:40 atm which is a 7:00 pace. Is there any good formula or do you just have to guess?",How young is too young to run a marathon?
firstmarathon,"I have followed my training plan religiously and when I ran my 18 mile run I felt great. I went out Sunday to do my 20 mile practice run. Was having a bad day and didn't feel well and only made it 10. I was determined I had to do the big 20 practice run. I rested Monday and went out Tuesday to try again. I hurt my knee and made it about 15 miles. I'm supposed to take 2 days off. If I can, should I try running the 20 again this Sunday? My marathon is November 22nd.

Im supposed to be in the taper now. Should I just taper? Do I risk hurting myself if keep trying for 20 this close? It's a huge mental thing for me and I feel like if I didn't do 20 than I won't be able to do the marathon. Thoughts? Suggestions?

It's a soreness on the front (and slightly outer side) of my ankle that I don't notice until I put weight on the foot (left foot). Or if i push my heel into the ground while sitting on the floor. There's a stretched soreness.

firstmarathon,"Having entered the final week of a 16-week plan, I'm feeling quietly confident ahead of Sunday's marathon.

I've decided to break the run into the following chunks:

7km - warm-up (approx 5:45/km)
10km - opening up (approx 5:38/km)
15km - cruising speed (approx 5:30/km)
5km - almost there (approx 5:40/km)
5.2km - final push! (approx 5:50/km)

Sticking to this plan will give me a time of 
40:15 + 56:20 + 1:22:30 (First Half in 1:58:58) + 28:20 + 30:20 = 3:57:45 (Second Half in 1:58:47, negative split by 11 seconds!)

A friend is running the LA Marathon, one of Competitor Magazine's 15 bucket-list marathons, on 2/14/16, and it just so happens the Nike Running intermediate marathon training plan recommended for my running ability takes 16 weeks. This may be my last chance to run the LA Marathon for several years, as I'm not sure where the residency match will take me or if I'll even have the time or energy to train for a marathon.

* Does anyone have any experience with this training plan?
* If 16 weeks is too short, any recommendations for marathons happening before late June 2016?
* Any current medical interns, residents, or doctors still successfully training and running half- and/or full marathons?

firstmarathon,"So I am a recreational runner, 33 yo male, run 25-30 miles a week, never ran more than a 10k, but it's more because I'm cheap and can't bring myself to pay more than $30 for a bib to a race when I can go and just run that distance myself with my iPhone playing some music and all ..

firstmarathon,"Hi /r/FirstMarathon!

Completed my first marathon this past weekend (Oct/17/2015)! Ran the Kansas City Marathon in 4:31:50. Read a lot of helpful and inspiring posts here so I thought I would give back by posting my own training and 26.2 mile experience! Also, made a chalk board display holder for all my [bibs and medals!](http://i.imgur.com/F8OVZoe.jpg)

**Background:**
I am 6'2"" and weighed in around 204lbs. I only started running after I got the freshman 15 in college. I had only run one official race before I started training for a marathon, a 10k turkey trot. The goal to run a marathon was a New Year's resolution set between my close cousin and I. His wife and my sister decided to join us as well. Unfortunately, due to a knee injury around week 21 of training, my cousin had to drop out, and his wife and my sister followed. So I did it alone!

**Training timeline:**

1) Finding a program

Google Google Google. We were all so nervous at the daunting task at hand, we added 11 weeks onto this 26 week beginners program to give us a whopping 37 week training program. Here's some advice, don't do that, it's just wayyyyyy too much jogging. You probably (everyone's different) don't need to jog that much to jog a marathon. 

2) Burn out and Drop outs

I got to week 21 of the above mentioned program with a total of 246.75 logged miles before I just got BURNT OUT on running. This was about the same time my cousin had his knee injury and him and his wife dropped out. My sister soon followed because she just wasn't putting in the training miles. I still had another 16 weeks of training left and in all honesty, I was ready for a marathon right then and there. I had put in a few hefty jogs, the longest being 17 miles, so I know I could have done it. Fun fact/stat, at this point in time I weighed 184lbs (20lbs lost)! 

2) Finding another program

Being so burnt out on jogging, I decided to take a few weeks off. I know, crazy. But I found a 13 week training program here, and decided what the hell, I'll take a few weeks off and start fresh. So I did, and it was great. Honestly, this is the program I should have started with in the first place. One thing about this program, I shortened the 20 mile and the 22 mile jogs. I didn't want to put myself out of training by jogging too long of a distance. So I missed a few miles due to that and other reasons in this training program... jogged 201.4 miles under this program (not quite the suggested 324.2 suggested miles). 

4) Official Races

Sorry, this doesn't exactly fall in order of my timeline, I grouped all these races into one section. Since the start of training I ran 7 official races: Two 5k's, one 10k, and four Half Marathons. Running official races has SO many perks: great practice, fun environment, motivational, port a potties, and best of all AID STATIONS. I hated going out on jogs (especially long ones) having to carry a Gatorade, water bottle, GU, and a snack. Well if you run an official race, you don't have to carry all that nonsense because you are paying for those aid stations stocked with Gatorade and water! Just that is worth the dough in my opinion, then in some cases, you get free massages, running gear, free music, and most importantly free beer! So, if there was an opportunity for me to run an official race, I did it. I would even plan my long jogs around half marathons. For example, if I was scheduled for a 16 mile jog, I would sign up for a half, run it, hand my medal off to my gf waiting for me at the finish line, and keep jogging until I hit 16 miles. I mentioned above that I made a display holder for all my medals and bibs, maybe something that needs to go in /r/DIY, but I thought you all might like it. 

5) Carb Loading

This was maybe the hardest part of it all. I was so nervous of hitting the wall or breaking down I wanted to do everything I could to avoid it. Much research suggested carb loading. Which I had done on previous long distance jogs, but nothing more than eating a ton of pasta the previous night(s) before. For the actual race, I decided to do some more in depth research. I read somewhere that for every pound you weigh, you should eat 4g of carbs. So at this point in time (3 days before race day) I weighed in at 193lbs. I was supposed to be eating 193lbs x 4g = 772g of carbs! I was excited at first, I cooked insane amounts of fried rice and pasta to prepare for the three days prior to race day. Bagels, cliff bars, whole loafs of Italian bread were consumed. I never once got to the 772g carb mark and stepping on the scale told me I had taken on 9 pounds of food! I don't know if Adam Richman from Man v. Food could have done it. In my case FOOD definitely won, and I never want to see fried rice again in my life. I wised up the last day of carb loading and consumed the majority of my carbs through Welch's juice, I bought three cartons and drank them all. Never been more hydrated in my entire life. I woke up extra early and ate a carb heavy breakfast and was ready for the race!

**Race Day:**
I decided I didn't really care what my time was, I just wanted to finish, but was expecting something around 5 hours. I had printed out my marathon plan complete with mile times, what to drink at every aid station, when to eat every GU, and even a worst case scenario ""oh shit, I hit the wall"" time sheet. The course time limit was 6 hours, I planned on following the 5 hour group (this race had official pacers jogging with signs). When I jumped in line, I couldn't get anywhere near the 5 hour group, no big deal I would catch up. The race started. I took it real slow, knowing how easy it is to jog too fast at the beginning due to all the hype. I eventually passed the 5 hour group, and then the 4:50 group. Had to take a pit stop at the port a potties at mile 4 to drain some fluid. Waited in line for what seemed like FOREVER!  When I jumped back into the race the 5:00 group had caught up to me. So I ended up passing the 5:00 hour group again. Then passed the 4:50 group again. Then the 4:40 group!!! I was feeling GREAT around the half way point, just ready to eat up another 13.1 miles. I had my Dad and Stepmom riding bikes around and popping up random places to cheer me on, take pictures, and hand me anything I needed. Their support helped a TON! I was laughing every mile when I looked at my current time, compared to the 5 hour mile times I had printed out on my ""sheet of doubt"". I was KILLING IT! Skip forward to mile 18.5, my Dad gave me a pre-workout powder mix I had bought from GNC and made earlier that morning. I knew that around this point in time I might be needing some extra energy. Tasted awful, but definitely gave me a crazy boost! I jogged the entire race, except for the port a potty stop, slowing down through aid stations, and walking twice around mile 23. My two walks were one minute each, my legs were just getting pretty stiff so I did the 5/1/5/1 approach (jog 5 min, walk 1 min, jog 5 min, walk 1 min) with some stretching. Still, the end came sooner then I wanted it to. I was still having too much fun, I really wasn't ready for it to be over. I sprinted through the finish line with a time of 4:31:50! Hugged all of my family and had the best cheeseburger and beer of my life! Never once put my earphones in, there was too much going on around me to take in and enjoy. There were bands, people chilling in their front yards, the high fivers, and other racers starting conversations with me. With all that going on you kinda just forget your'e running and just say ""I'll get there when I get there"". Anyways, crushed my goal of 5:00. Thought it was going to be hell and I was super worried, but it wasn't even close to hell and I was laughing the whole time. Super pumped about my results and couldn't be happier with them.

Tell everyone you can that you are running a marathon. The more people you tell, the less likely you will back out because of embarrassment/regret. 

Running is 90% mental, 10% other stuff. Do the training to get the 90%, and do some research on running science to get the other 10%. 

Shin splints: Some runners get them, some runners don't. I definitely GOT THEM. You just have to run through them, it sucks, but you just have to. The best advice for this is don't half ass your stretching. The second best advice I have is fill up an old Gatorade bottle with water, keep it in your freezer, and use the large cap to massage your shins after a run. 

If you are about to run a marathon for the first time and have any questions, feel free to ask! I know I had a ton of questions throughout training.

Hi to all!
I raced my first full marathon this last Sunday in Lisbon, Portugal. I want to share my experience with you. I know it's long, sorry...  

**Pre-race**  

After doing a few HM's a friend convinced me to do a 20k trail race in early May, and I just loved it! It was a lot of fun! The day after the race I went home and looked for some more trail races I could do and found a really cool 48km race in Azores. The next day I was talking to a co-worker that does ultras and she told me: ""if you want to do this, I think it’s a good idea to do a road marathon first"". I couldn't think of anything else for about 2 days, so signed up. I also convinced two other friends to join and so I had almost 6 months to get ready.
I was already in good shape, and managed to do a 29km (18miles) run before the end of May. I signed up for a free training plan with the run keeper app. June and July I was in Africa for work. This didn't cause too many problems training during the week, but the longer runs on the weekend were a bit more challenging. I was confident I could do a sub 4hr race, since on one of my long runs I managed to PR my HM time with 1:55:55, I did it when I should do a shorter run with easy pace, but I was feeling good. Big mistake. I got home and my right foot hurt. I ignored it, and this was early July. Got back to Europe in august and bough a Garmin watch so I switched training plans for one that was more aggressive (5x week), one that I found on the Garmin connect website. I think this was a problem later on. I continued my training but my foot kept hurting. I treated it twice a day with an anti-inflammatory gel for the whole month of august. It hurt but I kept putting all my runs in, including the long runs. I couldn't run for about 2 weeks in early September due to several reasons, mainly because I got back to Africa for work. After this 2 weeks my foot didn't hurt at all when I walked as it did before, but on my next run in mid-september it hurt again and I thought I had a serious injury, so I stopped running. 
I was going back to Europe in the begging of October so I made a doctor's appointment, expecting to hear him say I had a stress fracture and had that I had to stop running. Nope. It was just tendinitis! He said I could go to the race if I wanted, i should take some ibuprofen and wear an elastic foot and was all good. Of course I did! I was happy I could go without injuring myself but I was worried because I didn't run at all in September. By this time I should be tapering so I follow my plan anyway, and tapered.  

**Race morning**  

It rained a lot in Lisbon the day before, with heavy winds. There were thunderstorms predicted to the day of the race. I had laid all my gear down the day before so I was prepared for any kind of weather and could decide what to wear 20min before the start. Turns out, it rained all day and stopped just 10mins before the start and all day there was very good weather and temperature. Yey!

**Race start**  

I ran with a friend and we had the plan to go very easy, since neither of us had any time in mind, although we would be very happy with a sub 4:30. The race was very well organized and there was no chaos at the start, so all was good.

**1km - 8km**  

This was difficult for me. We were doing 6:00 min/km (~9:30/mile) and my HR was around 155bpm. I knew about cardiac drift and i knew this was high for me, for this pace. We made an effort to go slower but it was difficult. Also I was not in the zone and was not feeling that great, but kept my mind from thinking how much was left and focused on my breathing to help lower my HR. My friend usually finishes races after me, but now I’m thinking he better today than I am. No problems with my foot.

**10km - 20km**  

Now I’m in the groove. I'm not really feeling the km's go by. I'm enjoying the landscape and the atmosphere. We are still doing 6:00 min/km (~9:30/mile) and it is a conversational pace. The conversation is cool has well: my friend moved abroad before we signed up and we got a chance to catch up. I got a rock in my shoe at km 14 and had to stop. In order to catch my friend I did 1 min at 4:30min/km (~7:14/mile) but it was ok. No problems with my foot.

**21km - 25km**  

We do the first split in 2:09:05. It is a good time. I'm still feeling as fresh as before, but my friend is starting to get tired I think. We slow a bit, but not much. No problems with my foot.

**25km - 30km**  

Now we are slowing more. I'm still feeling good, but my friend is getting more tired. I remind him that there is nothing wrong in taking walking breaks, and at km 30 he says he has to walk for a bit and we both start to walk. It only lasts for me for about 10 seconds and I tell him that I’m going but he will probably catch me because I was taking a walking break later. No problems with my foot.

**30km - 35km**  
Since I’m alone I put my headphones on I start to listen to some music. I have a running playlist on Spotify and let me tell you: it is magic. I started to run faster and feeling better and better. I was doing 6:18/km (10:8/mile) before km 30 and now I’m doing 5:18/km (8:31/mile)! And I’m feeling great! I start to outrun everyone around me and the music is electrifying. I'm singing and playing air drums and air guitar. At km 34km the course is the same for the people doing the HM and it is difficult do zig zag around people.  No problems with my foot.

**35km - 40km**  

I start to feel a bit tired, and I’m thinking I pushed too much so I slow down a bit. There is these two songs by Eminem that always motivate me. This time it almost makes me cry because I'm tired and it’s difficult to control my emotions (is this a ""marathon feeling""?), but I’m not giving up and song is about this same feeling. My HR is close to 190bpm at around km 37 so I decide do take a walking break to lower my HR to ~160bpm so I walked for 500meters. I eat a gel and I continue with similar pace as before and the music is still going and driving me forward and forward. No problems with my foot.

**40km - finish**  

I forget I’m tired, and I’m just moving forward. I know we are almost there and I know this feeling of almost being at the end of a race. It's almost over, so I push a bit more. The music is still pumping. The last km is amazing with so many people cheering you on! It really energizes you. I did the last 500meters with 4:30min/km (~7:14/mile) pace, and according to my Garmin my HR reached 200bpm. At the end I crossed the line with 4:14:40 so I did a very negative split! I'm tired but happy. And my friend finished in 4:25:14. No problems with my foot.

I loved it, and I’m doing it every chance I get. There is some unfinished business with this race and I will be back next year.

**The next day**  
Yeah, going down stairs sucks big time. 
I have this strange feeling that running a marathon is not that big of a deal, I don't know why. Did anyone have that feeling?
",I did it! Is this a big accomplishment?
firstmarathon,"I started Higdon's Novice 1 at the beginning of August. My weekly mileage currently runs in the low to mid-30s. Last weekend I had an 18-miler, which I completed in just under 3.5 hours (11:30 pace). 


Another relevant fact: the local marathon I was aiming for has since been rescheduled to March. 


All of these things considered, I'm contemplating dropping my current plan altogether and starting another plan that (1) lines up with the new marathon date and (2) includes some type of speed work. Most plans I've seen involve very manageable mileage (midweek runs no longer than 6 and long runs no longer than 8-10) for the first month; this gives enough time for me to wrap-up the semester without having to decrease or cancel runs on the day of.


I'm kind of bummed about the move of the marathon date, but it seems to have worked out since this semester will require vast amounts of time to keep up with class work. I figured I could get rid of the ""I'm bummed"" feeling by simply writing-off this first plan as a way of increasing my base mileage before the *actual* marathon training. My pace has plenty of room for improvement (it was 12:30 when I began a little less than 3 months ago).

firstmarathon,"Just ran my first Marathon yesterday 

I began training for the marathon around about July, which is to say that about then I added two hour long runs on Saturday on a rail trail, I was following Hal Higdon's novice plan 1 

Previously I generally did an hour long jog on Tuesday, speedwork on Wednesday and some tempo runs on Friday

Suddenly around August disaster! Iliotibial issues on the right crippled me, thankfully it turns out they were caused by flat feet and one visit to the podiatrist later away I went for the 32km one week later where I promptly crashed into a wall around 26km (don't run without hydration or sustenance kids)   

Suddenly another disaster! Bad stitching in a pair of shoes meant I had to switch to a neutral shoe for a week and I forgot to take out a sole from the original when I went for my Saturday long run, ilotibial returned with a vengeance and this time there was no quick fix

The attempted fixes

Foam rolling and various types of stretches made it better but never so good that the knee could go past a bit of a hilly 3k

The quick fix

On the day before the marathon I bought a knee brace, a heavy one with no breathing room for the knee cap

The day

There I lined up with a knee brace I'd never worn before yesterday and began running and for two hours everything was fine and then around 22km by Achilles began to ache and by 30km it had given me mild iliotibial on the left while being hell in its own right and I walked the final 12km for a finish time of 4h54m

What I've learned 

Injuries don't go away as soon as they stop bothering you

My mistake partially was thinking that that iliotibial was gone just because I could run past it, don't think you can just go onto a soccer field as soon as you feel you can run

All stretches matter

There's probably some link between the Achilles and the knee brace but the bigger thing was that in the tapering I'd mostly been neglecting the Achilles to focus on my ITB, all stretches matter and if you forget one it's coming back to bite you, remember you are running for hours 

Squatting allows you to abuse your lower legs

At around August I also began to be able to squat my own bodyweight, it's due to that that the problem was able to be absolutely said to be flat feet and not some other thing and it was able to be fixed given one podiatrists hour, I'm not saying it'll solve all problems but it's worked for me 

Make sure you're doing nothing for the next couple of days afterwards

As of a few hours ago I can now walk properly, it's a bit painful but hey! I didn't have the slightest idea that it would be my Achilles that would do me in, you can't know what will happen until the race happens so make sure you don't have to be running around the day after ",My first marathon (or War of the Worlds meets The Iliad)

I'm following the ""Beginner Marathon - To Finish"" plan on RunKeeper though I have modified the long runs to be 18 and 20 since I didn't feel the 16 max run would prepared me enough.     That being said I have some generic questions about training.

1. After the long weekend runs, it seems like there is about 6 hours where I feel like I got hit by a bus.   It wears off and then I'm good to go with the normally scheduled run the next day, but my question is:  is that always the way it is or am I feeling this because it's the first time I've ever asked my body to do this crazy stuff?

2. For the 5-6 hours after a run it also feels as if my body has trouble regulating its temperature.  I'm not talking while I'm walking around in sweat soaked clothes after running, I'm talking post shower sitting down 3 hours later and I get what I can only assume is like a menopausal woman's hot flash.

3. During my training my muscles are taking to the beating I'm giving them WAY better than I feel my joints are.  The joint aches go on longer in other words (though it does not impact training in any way).  Is that the same for you folks?

4. Last one...after this race I'm going to need to drop into a sort of maintenance mode.  I'm thinking about 20-25 miles a week with a long run of about 10-ish during the winter.  Once I have a new race I'll then begin following the new plan.  Will that help me retain what I've worked so hard to build or is it always a game of: build-to-race; lose ability down to the level of activity you are at; build back up to race again?

firstmarathon,"I did it! I ran my first marathon on Sunday! 

I followed Hal Higdon's Novice 1 plan and I stuck to it pretty well - I got in my 18 mile and 20 mile runs but I subbed out a couple of medium distance long runs for hikes. I moved to Vermont about a month into marathon training and I couldn't resist exploring, which was sometimes hard to balance with saving my legs for runs. There were some unknowns in my training that lead to pre-race anxiety - when I first moved here I was really discouraged because my pace dropped almost a full 2 minutes with all the rolling hills. I made the decision to use the pace I was running in Chicago, run for time, and not track my pace in order to keep my motivation high. But, leading up to race day I started to seriously worry I didn't get enough miles in or wouldn't finish under the cut off or that I ran too many miles on trails. Thankfully, none of that was the case!

All the hills really helped me on such a flat course - my legs and lungs felt great throughout. I had enough left in the tank to sprint the final half mile! I had some pain on the ball of my foot (pretty sure I should have gotten new shoes) and had to walk a bit more than I planned miles 18-22, but I never once felt discouraged or like I wouldn't finish. The crowd support was amazing and I honestly had so much fun. I'm smiling in every single one of my course photos :). I just kept telling myself, ""YOU'RE RUNNING A MARATHON!"" 

I sobbed as I crossed the finish line (and a couple of other times on the course - we passed a nursing home and all the residents were in their windows waving to runners!). I'm a slow runner (I finished in 5:25) but I'm ridiculously proud of not only finishing, but of how I managed to have fun throughout, even when it hurt! At mile 18 I belted out Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run; I think people thought I was insane but I don't care. I also decided to dedicate each mile to a person in my life and wrote their names on my arm - I figured if I got discouraged I could distract myself by thinking about them for a few minutes. Surprisingly, this never happened and I even forget to check my list a couple of miles! Even though I was out there for such a long time, it felt like it went by so quickly! 

I wouldn't change a thing about any of it - I enjoyed training (even the insomnia, running before the sun came up, etc) and could not have asked for a better first marathon. My dad died almost two years ago and until this, I felt like someone hit the pause button on my life. I was just getting through days instead of living them because how do you accept that your favorite person suddenly no longer exists? But then I started running and I learned to run through the pain instead of from it. Running this marathon was everything to me. It was the best day of my life, hands down.

firstmarathon,"**Background:** 39 year old male, started running in 2012, ran 2 half marathons that year, then stopped running seriously until this year. Started up in February and weighed 294.4 lbs.

**Training:** It was pretty much a home brew based on the 10% rule, the Team World Vision training, and what I knew I was capable of based on my 2012 running. started slow and low, trained for the training, and just built up from there.

**Goal:** 2 real goals. The first was to finish the marathon. I had said that when I did the half in 2012, but this time I meant it. My second goal, though, was the one I really wanted to get, which was to finish under 6:30, a 15 minute pace. (the pace where they started clearing the course). I finished, but missed that by about 18 minutes.

**The good:**

- The people of Chicago and the volunteers were amazing. 
- I decided not to wear my camelbak and just took the belt back. glad i did, because the stations were enough and did not close down even at our pace.
- Was able to raise almost $2000 for clean water projects in Africa through Team World Vision
- The first 9 miles felt pretty good. I didn't even turn on my music for the first 7 because the crowds were so energizing. 
- My knee that had been giving me problems was a non-issue.

**The not-as-good:**

- Weather was on the warm side
- Around mile 12.5 I was starting to tire more than I should have been. looking back, I ran faster than intended on the first half - Mainly, i think, because the gps that was telling me my pace was whacked out from the tall buildings. my course looks more like a heart monitor than a run  map. My intention was to run/walk 8min/2min., but at 13, I panicked and dropped to 2/2 to try and recover. That didn't work, because once I dropped that far, I wasn't able to get back up to where I wanted to be, pace-wise. oh well.
- Miles 19-26 sucked, but that's normal I suppose. My feet and ankles were killing me from being on them so long (waiting around before the start probably didn't help on that front, either.)  What made things worse, though, was how demoralizing it was for them to start clearing the course. Crowds thinned, banners came down, and probably the worst thing was, the mile markers went away after mile 20. So from 20-26.2 I had no idea how much further was left.
- At the finish line, being so late in, we were not able to actually run under the finish arch, but were shuffled off to the side to walk around it to where the medals/bananas/etc were. That was pretty disappointing.
- I think the worst thing for me, is that my finish time has not shown up as being recorded. I know that I finished - I went over the tracker in front of the finish arch - but my finish time does not show up, and so if you look under the list of ""Finishers"" in the results, I am not listed with them. It probably shouldn't bother me, but it does. I finished. I want numbered with the finishers. It isn't as though they shut down the timers, either, because there are people who are listed after  when I came in. I do not understand what happened there.

**Final thoughts:**

My unofficial time was 6:48 or 6:50 +/-, depending on whether you go by their estimated time or my MMR time. I finished, and only missed my goal by 18 minutes, so that wasn't too bad for a 260 pound man.

When people ask how it was, I ask if they want the long version or the short one. The long version would take all day to tell. The short one is just ""It was amazing and horrible all at the same time."" ",[Race report] Chicago Marathon - first
firstmarathon,"**What**: Hartford Marathon  
**When**: October 10, 2015  
**Where**: Hartford, Connecticut  
**Why**: My first marathon in the city where I did my first half marathon  
  
**Race Info**: The Hartford Marathon is the big race done for the last 22 years in the capitol of Connecticut. It is put on by the Hartford Marathon Foundation, who from my experience so far has an amazing staff and really does a great job putting together an awesome race.  
  
**My Background**: Last year around April I met some new friends at the rock climbing gym I go to. A couple of them were runners and one was training for a local half marathon coming up. I went and supported her on accomplishing her first ever half marathon. It was my first time being around the activity of a race or running event. It intrigued me after seeing everyone running and competing. About a month or two later, the other friend asked if I would train for the Hartford Half Marathon in October. I initially was not going to do it. I wasn't a runner and didn't enjoy running. I was a high school athlete and did intermural sports in college and cycle/mountain bike, but not running. I was somehow convinced to start the training plan at least and go from there. If I liked it, I would sign up, if not then no problem I could stop. Eventually I committed to running the half in Hartford of 2014. Soon enough it became race day for my first ever half marathon. It was 40 degree and raining. Not the greatest day to keep spirits high but I had it set that I wanted to run a sub 2 hour half marathon. I was able to accomplish that race in 1:56:51.  
  
The winter came along and I skied and didn't run. The end of winter was still a little ways off, I got an email from the Hartford Marathon Foundation about what they were calling ""The Triple Half Challenge"". Complete three specific half marathons and you get a medal and jacket plus discounted race entry. So I thought sure why not! I was signed up and started training that day. As my training progressed toward the first half in April I felt the urge to sign up for other races other than the 3 halfs I had already signed up for. I will get to the grand total later.  
  
At some point it also hit me that why keep running halfs when I can just run the Hartford Marathon instead. So I eventually switched over to the full from the half.  
  
**Nutrition**: I just kind of kept things simple. Eggs and OJ for breakfast. Rice, Veggies, Chicken for lunch. Dinner was a mix of things but always some kind of meat and oatmeal or veggie with some other random items.  
  
Runs would consist of Shotbloks or gels depending on the distance. I would only take a gel or Shotblok with me if it was a 12 mile or longer run. Water was runs longer than 9 miles unless it was a really hot day during the summer.  
  
**Training**: I used [Hal Higdon's Novice 1](http://www.halhigdon.com/training/51137/Marathon-Novice-1-Training-Program) to train for the marathon. Due to my other schedule races, there were some weekends I ran a little bit more than I should of and probably faster as well. I stuck to the training otherwise and backed out of plans with friends for weekend trips because my runs got to long to not do, such as the 16+ mile range.  
  
The first time distances starting at 16+ miles were where it became challenging. 14 miles wasn't too terrible because it was slightly longer than a half marathon so no problem. My 16 mile run wasn't great because I drank too much the night before. 2 weeks later for the 18 mile run went really well. I was able to run at an 8:30 min/mile pace average and I felt great afterwards. Then 2 weeks after that for the 20 mile run, I had a rough day. It was hot and humid and I had to walk for a quick moment twice and averaged a 9:30 min/mile for the run. I wasn't discouraged but just felt I had a bad day and the weather didn't help. I started the taper as you should. The problem was that I had a trail half marathon (my first ever trail race) the week after the 20 mile run and I ended up running it really fast although it was extremely hilly. My legs might have not recovered properly during the taper because of it. But I even did the 2 mile run the couple days before the marathon. After that, it brings me to the day.  
  
**Race Day**: It was supposed to be a gorgeous day so I was very excited when I woke up. It was upper 40's at 5am and the high was mid 60's with sunshine all day long. For an 8am start the weather was going to be pristine running weather. My parents drove up from New Jersey to experience their first ever race day event and to support me through my run. We left for Hartford around 5:45 so we could get there around 6:30 and have plenty of time to get a parking spot, use the port-o-potties, and warm up before grouping up for the race.  
  
My goal for the race was to run sub 4 hours. I was going to run with the 4 hour pace group and if anything add or subtract time depending on how I felt. With my long runs being wacky I wasn't sure how it would go and I was semi freaked out about the distance once I passed 20 miles.  
  
The gun goes off promptly at 8 am and we shuffle along the starting line. The half marathon and full marathon run together for the first mile or so and eventually split off. My pace group was easy to stay with because my pacer ran with a large American flag and he convinced some of his Ironman friends to run with him and help pace the group so I knew where to stick to and follow their lead.  
  
**Note**  All the mile times are based on my Strava through my Apple Watch. That's what I've been using and I might have had a hiccup toward the beginning because of the massive group trying to sync to GPS at that time. 

**Mile 1-5: 8:27, 8:12, 8:44, 9:03, 9:10**  
The first mile or so when the half and full marathon groups are together is really hard to pace properly so that's why the first to miles are crazy and also with being in the city, my Apple Watch using Strava was having a little weird time connecting and I might have paused for a few seconds while running but not entirely sure. The first mile goes around the main park downtown where the finish line was and post race activities are. The marathon splits with the half and we are running through some neighbors and eventually turn under I-91 and enter a park that is along the Connecticut River. These views were beautiful for such a great day it ended up being. Sadly I didn't take any pictures because I was more concerned with running than pictures at that point. We followed the river in the park until about mile 4.5-4.75 before entering back onto the local roads. We had to cross a railroad track near that point and it was definitely a hazard for someone who wasn't paying attention. The entire time there was a pretty big group of 4 hour marathoners and the pacer accompanied with his friends were awesome. Constant talking and story telling about their Ironman's and upcoming training or trip they plan on doing. Everyone in the group was really going strong and joining in one the conversation and telling their own stories. People were proudly running with the American Flag at times to share the load during the race. 
  
**Mile 6-9: 9:03, 9:03, 9:05, 9:10, **:  
The pace really steadied out at this point because we were more thinned out and separated from other runners. In between mile 5 and 6 was where you went over the Founder's Bridge which is a 3 lane highway on one side and a 4 lane highway on the other side because it goes straight into downtown Hartford. To get over the bridge we ran up the on ramp and on the actual highway surface which was really cool to be able to run on a highway that was closed off just for the race. Mile 6-7 was just some neighborhoods and nothing exciting but 7-9 were on the other side of the river now and we got to run near a lot of it and had great views with the sun out. Mile 9 up to the market for 10 were just some major roads with half the road closed off and there was some support by the locals that live on that road.  
  
**Mile 10-13.1: 8:41, 8:52, 8:48, 8:45 with an official half marathon split of 1:58:38**  
Around mile 9.5 is where it became the big stretch almost. Starting at mile 9.5 it was the beginning of the out and back part of the course.We were still on a major road for some of it but to make it a little interesting there was a slight detour for mile 13 before rejoining back onto the out and back. At 13.1 you turned onto Main Street in East Hartford and kept running for a long period of time.  
  
**Mile 14-20: 8:49, 8:55, 8:55, 9:17. 8:58, 9:14, 9:17**  
This part of the course was on a local road that just went on for a really long time. We re-entered the road at the half marathon point and the turn around was at mile 17. Just a lot of locals outside of their homes yelling and screaming giving us support. This point is where I was okay still and feeling good. I was taking my gels but it seems that after the half distance, my body wasn't liking the taste. It might have just been the mocha that I don't really like in general and my body was pushing back. I felt iffy after I took the mocha's and probably could have thrown up after each gel following mile 14. At the turning point of mile 17 it was back down the straight away forever and ever. Approaching mile 20 and I was ""Okay"" kind of. I could tell me body was starting to degrade and it was getting a lot harder. From my training, I wasn't technically able to run 20 miles straight so in my head I was slightly worried but knew I could finish the race without having to walk. I was still with the pacing group but the group size diminished over the miles and was probably down to 15-20 people maybe.  
  
**Mile 21-25: 9:21, 9:50, 10:28, 10:04, 9:58**  
As you can see from my times above, I began to drop off. My body just wasn't having it and didn't like me at that point. I was determined to not stop fighting my body shutting down on me. I was still on the long straight until the start of 24. Once 24.5 hit, you started to head back toward the city. The road leading to the 25 mile marker wasn't terrible. From the start of my mile 20 breakdown, there were 4 water stations until mile marker 25. I slowed through those and tried to stop to at least drink the fluid instead of trying to run and splash it in my face. Quickly got back at it after each station and had one more gel left around 23. I knew the last 1.2 miles were the only bigger up hill section of the already flat course but they were also the going to be the best parts of the course. Runners were spread apart fairly well at this point. I wasn't near many people and could see a couple people in the distance ahead. Mile 25 was the start back up to the Founders Bridge that was crossed previously on mile 5-6. I was able to recover a little bit from my breakdown but it was already a good sign that my sub 4 hour goal wasn't going to happen at that point but I wasn't going to be far off. The trek over the bridge was amazing. There was one runner in site in front of me but at that point there were multiple race photographers on the bridge. From my previous race experiences with photographs, I never get good pictures or I look like a complete disaster. So this time since I could see the photographers in front of me, I made sure to pose for the camera and had fun with it because in the end it was my first marathon and it's about having fun and accomplishing my goal to run a marathon. I'm really excited to see how the photos come out!
  
**Mile 26- 26.2: 10:12, 8:03**  
Getting over the Founders bridge back to downtown meant I knew I was close. I could see marker 26 and knew there was one more turn to the finish line. The crowds were growing as I grew near and I could hear the cheering and the yelling. I was giving people and Police Officers high fives and smiling from ear to ear. I knew it was almost over and that I had done it. The final 0.3 miles had you condense down with some railings right before the turn. At that point, I knew I had to go for it and just push it. I rounded the corner and it was all out. The ending of the Hartford Marathon is under a giant arch in Bushnell Park. It is the logo of the race and absolutely beautiful to run under. I was able to finish the race with an official time of 4:04:20 and was okay with that.  
  
Shortly after crossing the finish line you get heat wrapped and you start to walk toward receiving your medal. Hartford also gives a water bottle for all finishers. Shortly after that I called my parents to try and find them and then go get food. I ate some of the food and just kind of sat there for awhile. There was one more thing I had to do. I originally signed up for the *Triple Half Challenge* but didn't do the Hartford Half which was one of the three required to get the medal and jacket but because I did the full I was still able to claim my prize. We headed over there and picked up my awards before heading over to get a stretch out and then to the local YMCA for a free shower and going to get some real food.  
  
**Post Race**: The race was on a beautiful day in October and it was my first marathon. My training was iffy because I also do so many other activities besides running that I was probably more tired and didn't recover well. I'm not fully disappointed but I know I could have gotten that sub 4 hours if I had trained better.  
  
**What's Next?**: I'm pretty much set for big runs this year. I might do some smaller 5k's because of Halloween or Turkey Trots but probably no more half marathons. Other than the *Triple Half Challenge* there was also another challenge put up by the Hartford Marathon Foundation which was *The New England Double*. You run the Vermont City Marathon and Hartford Marathon and you get a really awesome medal and hat. I think my goal for next year is to do that. Up my marathon total to 2 and see how many half marathons I can do.  
  
**Totals for the year**: From October 11, 2014 to October 10, 2015 I was able to complete my first ever half marathon and also my first marathon. Between those 365 days, I raced a total of:  
* 3- 5k's  
* 6- Half Marathons  
* 1- Marathon  
I had an amazing year of running for just the summer of 2014 being my start to running and not enjoying it. Now I enjoy running and participating in races and plan to do so many more in the future.

Just wanted some advice about how to get over this funk I'm in. Ran in a half marathon yesterday with a goal of 2 hours. However, I finished 2:16 and I felt like crap the entire time. My legs felt as if I have never ran a day in my life. It got me really discouraged/ nervous and I just am not sure if I will be able to finish my marathon which is November 7th. The past weekend I was able to run 18 miles in 3.5 hours and felt tired but not in so much pain as I did with this race. I would appreciate any suggestions on how to get over this.

firstmarathon,"If this looks similar to [/u/kittenkaboodle17](https://www.reddit.com/r/firstmarathon/comments/3nqx0o/race_report_portland_marathon_xpost_from_rrunning/) it’s because I saw hers and thought it was well done. This is from Hartford Marathon today (Oct. 10)

**Background:** 25-year-old male who started seriously running about two years ago since I work a desk job and hate the gym. I did my first half marathon in Hartford last October and have done a few more since with a PR of 1:33:53 which was pretty damn fast for me.

**Training:** Although I hadn’t run a marathon before I did the Higdon Intermediate 1 plan picking up around week six. Before I jumped on the plan I was doing a base of 30ish miles a week with a long run of about 10 on the weekends.

**Goal:** I tried not to read too much into my half marathon PR since it was way faster than I ever ran in training. I went in shooting for a 3:30 but honestly just wanted to finish it in less than four hours since it was my first one.

**The Race:** I found the 3:30 pace group (it’s nice that this marathon has pace leaders, I don’t know if every race does that?) and off we went. I felt comfortable and fine for the entire first half and stuck with them. Took a few Gatorade chews which I had been using during training, alternated water/Gatorade at stops depending on how I felt.

At about Mile 17 I started to feel like I was losing it, but in my right quad, which was a little different. Usually I feel it in my calves first when I’m starting to run out of energy. As we passed 17 I dropped back from the group and my pace started to slow. I went from 8:00 on the dot gradually up to 9:30 for the 24th mile before speeding up a little at the end.

The last nine miles were pretty awful and I felt discouraged because it seemed like I was moving so slow, but I just kept going and didn’t worry about who passed me, etc. This was also a tough stretch of the course since there’s an out-and-back without many people cheering you on etc. and the runners are pretty spaced out so it’s harder to find people to pull you forward.

All told I finished in **3:39:04**. So I’m pretty happy about cracking 3:40, since that became my “secondary” goal when I started to slow.

**Final Thoughts:**

1. Not sure what I could have done to prevent hitting the wall. My last 20-mile training run (turned out to be closer to 21) I lost some pace at the end but not to the same extreme.

2. I wish I had run a race (preferably a half but even a 10K) closer to the marathon. The last race I did was a half in June. I tried to sign up for another half in September but it was full/others were too far away.

3. I’m really glad I didn’t stop to walk because if I did I don’t think I could have kept going. I walked through one aid station and almost couldn’t get going again.

4. In a way not hitting 3:30 gives me something to shoot for if/when I do another marathon.

5. I actually feel pretty good right now but I’ve heard that tomorrow may be a different story.

firstmarathon,"Might be a stupid question, but bare with me. I'm running my first marathon on the 18th. My shoes that I've used for most of my training are pretty worn and I was starting to feel the effects of them, so I bought a new pair (same brand, same style) in hopes of getting them ""broken in"" before the big day. I've put about 20 miles on them, and have about 20 miles left in my training. Should that break them in enough to do 26.2? Should I use my old ones instead?

firstmarathon,"Hey everyone,

I made my marathon debut on Sunday at the Twin Cities Marathon! My race went flawlessly (solid 10:00/mile pace) for the first half, and around mile 17 my legs completely gave up. I was wobbly, my legs/knees were killing me, and I had to run/walk the last 8 miles. I wasn't that ""tired"" per se (I have an excellent cardio base) but my legs were the only thing slowing me down. I finished the race in 5:09:27. I was really hoping for sub-5:00 but I was super close and I now know it's within my ability!

I'm running my next marathon in February (L.A.) and am wondering what types of workouts you would recommend to increase the stamina of my legs. I have the cardio ability to make it 26.2 miles but clearly despite my long training runs, my legs were too weak to keep me running the entire time. They hurt so bad in the last 5 miles that for some crazy reason, running actually felt BETTER on them than walking did until they cramped again causing me to have to walk.

Would long fast runs be the solution here? Should I be doing leg weight workouts at the gym? If so, which ones do you recommend? Would hill training fix this? 

Any advice here on how to build good leg strength for finishing off a marathon when you already have a solid cardio base would be tremendously appreciated!

firstmarathon,"Warning, this is going to be long so I apologize in advance! 

**Background:** I’m a 24 year old female who has been running off and on for about 4.5 years. I’ve done a few half marathons before (PR of 1:37:30 last summer) and quite a few 5 and 10K’s. For the past few years I had the marathon dream but I never felt quite ready to commit to it, and looking back I think that was actually a really wise decision. One of my biggest challenges with running in the past has been consistency, so some months I would log 100+ miles and then some I’d have 30 or less. I’m a full time grad student in a medical profession and it was really easy to convince myself during busy weeks (which is most of them) that there just wasn’t enough time to get those runs in, which of course isn’t true! As that’s obviously not a good recipe for improvement, this year I decided I wanted to get more serious about running and really work on that consistency. Starting in January I started averaging 20-30mpw, and then gradually increased that a little bit to prepare for a half marathon in May, the Rock ‘n’ Roll half in Portland. My plan was to get through the race and then if I still was feeling good afterward, I would sign up for the full Portland marathon. When I went to the expo to pick up my race packet for the half however, they were offering a deal if you signed up in person for the full so I decided why not, might as well save some money!

**Training:** I bought a copy of Advanced Marathoning by Pfitzinger and started following the 18/55 plan. I mostly stuck with it, but definitely had to modify it a bit along the way to better accommodate my schedule. Training went pretty well for the most part, but with a few minor hiccups along the way. The first was rolling my ankle during a 3:30am training run (I was leaving early for a conference and was determined to get it in) using only my headlamp for light. Not really the smartest idea considering the street I was on at the time was a little bumpy. The second was getting really sick one weekend and unfortunately these both led to missing long runs, but other than that things went mostly fine. I did run into some knee problems about halfway through the program, probably because I wasn’t really doing anything in the way of cross-training (stupid I know), but once I started doing the stretches from [this video](https://youtu.be/LDhKVtkfnsg) the pain got a LOT better. As I mentioned in the previous section, consistency and making excuses is something I have struggled with in the past, and I was really proud of myself for sticking with the program and getting the runs in even when it was difficult or meant getting up super early or staying up super late. I even ran one of three 20 milers on a treadmill because the air quality was horrible from a nearby forest fire, and I was determined to get it in.

**Goal:** Since it was my first marathon and I wasn’t sure exactly what I was in for, I told myself and others I’d be happy with anything sub-4 hours. My real goal was 3:45. While I sometimes considered trying to go for the BQ time of 3:35, I didn’t feel like I was ready or could sustain that pace for the full time so I decided it wouldn’t be smart to start the race that way and have a miserable second half.

**Getting There:** I woke up around 4am the morning of the race, and even though my alarm wasn’t set to go off for another half hour, I was too nervous and excited to fall back asleep so I decided to just get up and eat a little breakfast while I watched an episode of The Office on Netflix. Random I know, but when I’m nervous nothing calms me down like watching some Dwight and Michael Scott shenanigans! I had laid out all of my clothes and race items the night before, but somehow still found myself pressed for time and running all over the house when it was time to go. I had finally made it to the car and was putting on my GPS watch when I noticed part of the strap (the part that secures it into place) was missing and there was no way to fasten it so I had to run back into the house to first try to find the missing piece, and then when that was unsuccessful find some duct tape to be able to secure it for the race. I live about 45 minutes outside of Portland, and the plan had been to use public transportation (the max) most of the way in to avoid traffic and finding parking. We (myself and my poor husband) were going to get on the max at the 5:30 stop in order to arrive 45 minutes before the race started. Unfortunately the last minute scrambling made us late, and even though we parked in time and ran to the stop, we couldn’t quite get our tickets paid for in time before the max closed its doors and starting pulling away. It kind of felt like a moment from a bad movie, quite honestly. We ended up just driving in the rest of the way and parking in a garage that wasn’t too far away, so all things considered it ended up ok, even though it was a little stressful in the moment.

**The Race:** I made my way to my starting corral and just tried to stay calm, do a little bit of warming up and wait it out for the race to begin. With about 25 minutes to go, I decided I should try to pee one last time in hopes of not having to stop during the race, so I got in a ridiculously long line for the porta-potties. I had finally made it toward the front of the line when they sang the National Anthem and started moving everyone in our corral up to the actual start, so after an internal debate I decided to just ditch the line and move with my group and hope for the best. When we got closer to the starting line I spotted a glorious line of empty porta-potties (since the earlier waves had already left) so I made a mad dash for them at the last second but I wasn’t alone and I feel like that was a good decision in the end since I did end up making it through the race without having to stop (something I had been worried about). After the bathroom pit stop, I ended up crossing the starting line with the 4:10 pacer group. I had purposely signed up with a 4 hour predicted finish time even though I knew I would want to go a bit faster because I’ve heard so many times about how easy it is to go out too fast at the beginning of marathons, especially when it’s your first and emotions are high. And boy were they! I never full out cried or anything, but there were a few points during the race when I got a little bit emotional and the start was one of them. I just kept thinking about how I was really doing it! All of the work I had put into leading up to today and all of the time I had spent picturing and dreaming about this moment was here. With this in mind I tried to be really aware of my pace the first mile and go what felt like was too slow, and well… Turns out I overdid it a bit. Too be fair I run with a Nike+ TomTom GPS watch, and the instantaneous pace on it is absolute garbage especially when you are first starting a run, so I couldn’t really use that as a reliable source of my speed. So when I had finished the first mile and looked down to see my pace was 9:46 I panicked a little bit, because that was way, way slower than I had intended. I just tried to keep in mind that there was a long way to go and a lot of miles to make up for it. For the next few miles as much as I wanted to sprint enough to make up for that slow first mile, I just tried to slowly get my pace down and aim for around 8:30 minute miles. Things were going really well, and I kept being amazed at how quickly the miles were passing. I tried my hardest to take in the experience and enjoy all the scenery and spectators. Along the way I kept catching up to and passing the pacing groups, but I knew that by the end I’d have to catch up to the 3:50 group in order to get a 3:45 time, since I had started later than the 3:50 had. Since it was a warmer day, I made sure to drink at least a few sips of water at every aid station, and I also ate a Gu gel at about mile 5.5, 10.5, 16, and 21 miles (all before coming into aid stations so that I could wash it down with water). I continued to feel great heading up to the St. Johns Bridge at around mile 17, which is famously the most difficult hill in the course. I had done most of my long runs around a lake on a pretty hilly road, and I feel like this definitely prepared me well for the hills and I got to the top of the bridge feeling like an absolute CHAMP. I was loving every single freaking second of the race and I wanted nothing more than to do marathon after marathon after marathon until the day that I died (I’m telling you, the emotions are crazy!). I continued to feel good (although it did fade a little) through mile 20 where mentally I started feeling like I was getting close to the end, although physically I still had a long way to go. Around mile 23 is when the fatigue in my legs finally set in. While I can’t really say for sure if it was “The Wall”, I’m guessing it wasn’t that extreme because from what I’ve heard I probably would have known it was. That being said, it did get significantly harder from that point forward and my legs were feeling pretty heavy and dead. My previously blissful “marathons are the best thing ever” mentality quickly changed to “this is torture and I’m never going to finish”. My pace dropped a little bit in mile 23 and 24, but I picked it up again for the final 2 miles and change. I kept telling myself to dig deep, and that this was what I had worked so hard for and if I didn’t push myself as hard as I could now I would end up disappointed in myself. So that’s what I did. I took out my headphones for the final mile so that I could fully enjoy the cheers of the crowd (I highly recommend personalizing your bib with your name or nickname if you can - it’s awesome to have people actually cheer for you by name) and the experience of finishing my very first marathon. My last mile was my fastest at 7:44 minutes. When I turned the last corner and FINALLY saw that beautiful, magnificent finish line, I did my best to all out sprint until I crossed it. As cheesy as it sounds (and is) it’s a moment that I’ll never forget.

**Results:** My official time was **3:39:58** (average pace of 8:24 minutes/mile), and I am very, very happy with that. I beat my goal and finished feeling exhausted but not injured, so I feel like that’s about how it should be.

**Lessons Learned:** 

1. Although I still agree it’s smart to start slower to save energy for the end of the race, I way overdid it and could have shaved probably a minute and a half off my time by just running the first mile at my real pace instead of an exaggeratedly slow pace. That being said, I would much rather finish with my first mile being my slowest and my last my fastest than the other way around, so I’m ok with it. 

2. I was an idiot for not incorporating cross training from the very beginning, and I honestly feel lucky to have reached the starting line healthy. It most definitely needs to be included in my next training program. 

3. While I think the mileage for my level of training is about the most I could have handled without injuring myself, in the future I’d like to keep my base up and increase my mileage for future races, and I think this will be one of the biggest keys to improving. 

4. I need to learn how to get my crap together in the morning so that I don’t make myself late to future races. 

5. It’s probably time for a new watch so I can more accurately track my pace, as my individual mile splits were a little bit all over the place.

**Goals:** I will DEFINITELY be running more marathons in the future, with my next goal being to BQ. For the time being however, I think I want to focus more on getting my times down for some shorter races. For the 5 and 10K specifically, I have never really followed a training program with higher mileage, so I think there’s a lot of opportunity there for me to improve. Once I get those down then I’m hoping to be able to train a little bit faster so that I can race faster as well.

Thank you for anybody who made it all the way through that, I apologize again that it was so long! Mostly I really wanted to get this all down in writing so that I can always have it to look back on. All in all, my first marathon was absolutely an amazing experience in ways that I both hoped and feared it would be, and I can’t wait for the next one.

firstmarathon,"Hey Guys, 

I don't know many long distance runnings in real life so I'm just looking for some thoughts. I've been training for the Chicago Marathon since May. I followed my program pretty closely, but I've developed a lot of knee pain in the past couple weeks. Physical therapist says it's Patellar tendonitis. I've been taping, icing, ib profin-ing and cross training a lot - but I'm still worried I'm losing running strength. 

About 5 weeks ago I did my first 20 mile run. I was supposed to do it again three weeks ago, but that's when my knee really started bothering me and I quite at 13. Since then I've run 12, walked 10 and cross trained a lot. I'm worried I'm losing strength. Is there anything I can do this week to prepare myself without ending up with sore knees the night before the race?

Also, I'm slow as hell. I did my 20 miler in 5 hours - I'd hate to have to back down any more and wind up going even slower!

Finished the marathon in 4hours 49 seconds. Was aiming for 4 hours but really just happy to have finished the darn thing. My first run since the marathon was this morning and my marathon was run on 30 August hahah!

I trained fasted pretty much every single run (usually did runs in morning) and I didn't drink water on my training runs (this is not advice for others to do the same) - not even my long runs.

firstmarathon,"Hi First Marathoners,

Who is headed to Chicago next weekend?  

I'm a first time marathoner (and only one half marathon under my belt in March 2015, finished at 2:09).  I've been following Hal Higdon's Intermediate One Training plan.  I hit most of the workouts except for a few mid-week runs where I cross-trained with biking.  I live in Atlanta so the heat kept me indoors on the treadmill for most of the training.  Only in the last four weeks have I been able to run outside.  I'm a little nervous that my treadmill training will be insufficient, but I have felt strong most of time including now, so I'm pretty excited to see what my body will do next Sunday. 

My last long run was twenty miles, two weeks ago. I had to walk the last two miles.  I very foolishly tried running it without nutrition, so I bonked pretty hard. All my previous long runs had included food in the form of skittles, gatorade and/or clif bars.  I thought I could do one long run with no calories, and was very wrong.

Anyway, I'm sooo excited for next Sunday.  I have heard nothing but good things about Chicago.  I arrive Saturday morning, plan to head to the expo to browse and grab my number.  Then have an early dinner and hopefully get a good night's rest.  I have a nice feeling the weather will be perfect Sunday.  My plan is to run with the 4:30 pace group.  I have three gus and some candy I will consume at specific mile markers and it looks like the course is very well stocked with gatorade/water.  I'm not too worried about nutrition.  My overall concern is pain in my IT band and feet and maybe an unscheduled bathroom break.  

I'm aggressively tapering this weekend (no working out whatsoever).  Then gonna probably run a 10 miler Monday, a few 3-4 milers mid-week and a yoga session thrown in for good measure.  

What are your plans for this coming week?

Any recommendations for Chicago before and after the marathon? Restaurants?  Travel traps?

Any last minute marathon tips?  

Good luck to everyone attending especially the first timers.  We are all in this together.  Running can be a very lonely sport so I can't wait to celebrate with all of you the day of!

firstmarathon,"Hi all,

This is my first post here. I am not a new runner but I took some time off due to a non running injury last year (I hurt my ankle on a hike), so I haven't raced since 2014. I have decided to make my comeback race the Paris Marathon in April 2016. The past year I have been slowly working on building my mileage back up. I was racing half marathons before my injury. 

My current mileage is around 20-25 mpw, with my long run around 9 miles every other week. I alternate each week with tempo or pace runs. I know that is not enough to train for a marathon. I also do yoga a minimum of 3 times a week and bike. My easy runs are usually around 12 min/mile on very hilly terrain. I can't avoid hills on my runs (I hit around 3 in the first mile). 

With all that said, I need help deciding on a training plan. I'm currently using myAsics and while its helpful because it gives me training paces, I feel like the mileage is too low for my ability. The longest run is 18 miles. It also says that I can only achieve 5:22:22 as my time, even with training in the next 6 months. I don't believe that. I'm way to competitive for that, and before my injury my easy runs were 10:35 min/mile and that was with sporadic training. 

I've been looking at Higdon's Intermediate 1 or even Runner's World Smart Coach

I'm hoping to get at least sub 4:00 for my marathon. I have two questions: 1) Is that time realistic in the time frame? 2) Should I stick with myAsics or switch to another plan?",Training for Paris Marathon
firstmarathon,"After years of lower back issues stemming from being obese, September of last year was the first time I could run more than a few miles without injuring myself. That's when I started to take running seriously. I joined a running group, bought quality gear, and incorporated some cross-training. In May I was able to complete a Half Marathon at a time I was very proud of (1:44) so I set my eyes on a full in September. 

I didn't have any vacation plans this summer so instead I used my funds to hire a professional trainer. Let me tell you, it was so exciting meeting someone so well trained and helpful. My interest and aspirations in running increased ten fold. I got a lot more interested in sprinting and shorter runs, which actually made me lose interest in doing a full Marathon. There was a lot to longer runs I didn't particularly enjoy. First, it eats up a hell of a lot of time. Second, is the inconvenience of it all, having to go to the bathroom, drink and eat while running, etc. I also sweat a lot. I mean a lot. So I have to drink more water, which in turns means more bathroom trips. As you can see I was finding every excuse I could to get myself out of doing this Marathon. I remember the night where I admitted to myself that I'm just not going to do it. The next morning I was meeting my trainer to tell them I was going to just focus on shorter runs and races, but then a thought hit me. For all of the reasons I didn't want to run a Marathon, is more the reason I should do it. It's a huge challenge, and I hated the fact that I was turning my back on it. So instead of telling my trainer the Marathon is off, I felt damn excited to tell her that I'm all-in!

I entered training a bit over-confident for longer runs. The summer heat quickly humbled my pace, and instead of the usual 8:30 for longer runs, I was dipping to 9 or even 10 at times. I completely underestimated how hard it is to go on past 12 miles in the heat. It's a serious challenge. I found myself improving as I focused on eating healthier. Fruit felt like the biggest boost of energy and if I skipped a few days of eating it, my body let me know on harder runs. My trainer setup a fantastic plan: I typically did six days of running a week, one long slow run, two moderate distance and pace , two easy, and one sprinting (usually 50/100/150/200m dashes). I also focused on cross-training, lots of various forms of push-ups, sit-ups, crunches, planks, lunges, squats, minor weights, and lots of foam rolling. My trainer also had me do warm-ups which helped immensely (high knees, butt-kicks, weaves, leg swings, and skips to name a few).

Even with all of the above preparation, I was hitting a wall on my longer runs in the heat. I was stopping at mile 14 when I should have been doing 18. I wanted to give up. I felt myself at a cross-road, looking at two paths and veering to take the easier one. When I was over-weight, I ate whatever was cheapest and easiest to have. Here I was again, taking the easy route in life. 

I spoke with my trainer about my frustrations. Was I over-training? Maybe long distance isn't for me. She gave me great advice, which was to just get out there. Even if I had to walk, do the distance. Don't give up. 

I started to incorporate some breathing exercises into my routine, which really helped gather my thoughts. Looking at this whole challenge from a distance, I realized this is exactly what it takes to complete a huge undertaking. I need commitment, focus, and perseverance. I decided not to focus any thoughts or energy on what I can't do, but instead simply on what I can do. Try my damned best and don't worry about failing. It's the first time in my life I've felt like this. My entire life I've been so afraid of failing that it actually prevents me from ever trying.

Even with this new mindset, I wasn't posting better running results. I couldn't complete most of my long runs over 16 miles, especially without walking. But I went out there, tried my best, and didn't look back.

As I started to taper off and race week approached, friends and family were asking me how I expected to do. My original goal when I first started training was to run it in under four hours. I was honest, that was my original goal, but I haven't been able to nail all of my training runs, so I'm not quite sure. The time was kind of an after-thought now. It would be nice, but I'll be happy if I just just give it my all.

My Marathon happened this past weekend. I got very lucky with the weather, it felt between mid 50s to mid/high 60F the entire time. Race morning felt great. I had a good night's rest. Woke up early, did my routine, got out there early, but still faced some stomach troubles which actually led me to start five minutes late. When I finally started, I constantly reminded myself to take it slow in the start. Don't worry about trying to catch up on my missed starting time. Take these next few miles very easy, which is what I did. Mile seven is when I started to increase my pace. I felt good, no pain or issues, and the race crowd evened out granting everyone their own space. Miles were flying by. It was so refreshing running in a different environment, and the excitement of the race kept me going. Even gaining some elevation late in the course, I kept a steady pace. It wasn't until late Mile 24 / early 25 I started to experience some issues with my abductor muscle tensing up. I decided to stop and self massage while walking a bit. As I was walking I felt everything else start to tense up; my lower back, hamstrings, and quads. I was so close to the finish and knew I had it in me to start running again before my body starts to call it off, so I pressed on. My finish time was just under 3:59. 

Needless to say I'm ecstatic. It felt so good to overcome my worries about not being able to finish the race, and that I just went out there and gave it my all. It's fantastic I hit my original goal, but honestly, it wasn't the highlight of my experience. I felt like this marathon and training gave me some much needed grit, and the confidence of being able to tackle any challenge in life. ","My First Marathon, Training, and Background"

I can still run with it, albeit with a little bit of pain, and it is sore after running.


I guess my question is, where do I go from here?


-Marathon is just under 4 weeks away.


-I've completed 3 training runs of 20 miles or more, with the most recent on 9/12.


-I was planning on doing my final long training run this weekend.


-Prior to last week, I was getting in 40-45 miles/week.


Do I keep going with my plan? The pain is not bad enough that it prevents me from running, but I don't want to end up injuring myself. If I need to scale back on my mileage and not do my final long run, would I still be ok, having done my last long run 5 weeks before the marathon?



I'm kind of stressing about this and would appreciate any advice. Thanks!

firstmarathon,"I've been pretty active my whole life, but running has never been my thing, until a year ago when an ""at-work"" challenge motivated me to do a 5k.  Five months ago I started a regular marathon training program, and have just 4 weeks till the Seven Bridges marathon (http://sevenbridgesmarathon.com/) here in Chattanooga.

So, I jogged (slogged) my first 20 miles on Sunday; took right around 4 hours.  Started out at a 10:00 pace for the first 10 or so miles, but at 15 I hit the wall and basically had to slow jog alternated with lots of walking for the last 5 miles.  When I finished I was ""tingling"" a bit, and slightly light-headed, and I certainly didn't have it in me to do even another mile.  

For nutrition, I had a banana first thing that morning before I ran, then at 10 miles had another banana.  I had some chews during the first 10 miles as well.  I drank 3 20-oz bottles of Infuse (similar to Gateraid), and each bottle is listed to have 150 calories, so isn't that enough nutrition, or do I really need to have more substantial food along the way?

Also, how much water do you guys drink, or can you get enough hydration from the sports drinks themselves?

I completed the race at the official time of 4:01:17.  I was also awarded a prize for fastest in my age group (30-34)!
[Strava clocked my marathon time at 3:57:48](https://www.strava.com/activities/395617926).

**Training stuff:**
For the past 3 years I've been doing various DVD workout programs, sometimes coupled with a weekend run.  I completed the 90-Day Supreme Workout series 4 times, did Shaun T's T25 program (alpha, beta, and 2x gamma), and also his Insanity Max series (2 month program, repeated for 8 months).

One year ago, my wife and I moved to Boulder, CO from Mountain View, CA, and were instantly hit with the elevation change, which is a cool 5,300 ft.  Insanity Max really helped me acclimate to the change.  

About 8 weeks ago, Boulder hosted an Ironman, and after seeing it in person, we vowed to take up a similar challenge.  We noticed Boulder had a marathon coming up in 7 weeks, and we decided to go for it.

I had 2 more weeks of Insanity Max to finish my 8th month, so I tacked on an 8 mile weekend run to the end of both of those weeks, then I switched my schedule to the following:

Monday - 8 miles
Tuesday - Insanity Max - Power (HIIT strength workout)
Wednesday - 8 miles
Thursday - Insanity Max - Power (HIIT strength workout)
Friday - Day off
Saturday - Big Run
Sunday - Insanity Max - Pulse &amp; Ab Attack (Stretch/Yoga &amp; Abs)

Big run days went like so: 10, 13.1, 16, 17, Race.

For the first 2 weeks, I ran as fast as I could, usually averaging between 7:30/mi and 7:45/mi.  For the last 3 weeks, I tapered that to 8:00/mi then 8:30/mi and then 9:00/mi.

Overall, this was too accelerated, and I started getting pretty nervous after my 16 and 17 mile runs.  I'm not recommending anyone do this!  My next goal is to reset my schedule, and re-do the running part to follow a 4 month marathon plan.

**Actual Race:**
At first, I thought I could nail this thing in under 4, and that was my goal.  However, during my last 17 mile training run, when running my slow tapered pace of 9:00-9:30/mi, I hit the wall big time at mile 16.  So I dashed all hopes of getting a great time, and simply decided to do my best and accomplish it.

Then the race started.  I deliberately began a slow jog, finding a nice 9:00/mi pace in the crowd for the first mile, letting everyone start to find their space.  However, I quickly found myself settling in at a *very comfortable* 8:30/mi pace.  I knew that adrenaline can be deceiving and not to give in to any jitters and waste energy early on, so I stayed alert and tried to pay extra attention to my body.

At 10 miles, though, I was still cruising along and felt great!  When I hit the half marathon point (back at the finish) and began my second lap, it started to dawn on me, that I could actually get under 4.  Knowing the wall was still ahead of me, though, I just kept chugging along.

Then, I got really excited.  It was mile 20, and my watch said it had been 3 hours and 1 minute.  I had 59 minutes to complete 6.2 miles. All I had to do was clock 9:30/mi for the remainder of the race and I was in!  My only goal now was to crush this damn race and beat the 4 hour mark.

And I came so freakin' close... when I rounded the last corner, my watch (getting data from the Strava app on my phone) said it was 3:57+, but the clock at the finish line stubbornly said 4:01.  I was pretty bummed, but also happy as hell to cross that line and get that time for my first marathon.

Anyways, hope this wasn't too boring! Running is special because you don't need a lot of money or equipment to do it, just some willpower and grit.

However, all was going well until an injury during hockey caused me to take a backseat for a few weeks around around 12 weeks out. (No longer playing).

Now this wouldn't be an issue had I not become concerned during my most recent long run which was 28km/17.5miles at 6 weeks to go. To this point I have felt quite good during all my long runs so this shouldn't have been an issue however at 23-25 I started to feel quite gassed. (very different than past long steady) and from 25-28 I stopped multiple times to the point at 28 I felt more exhausted and out of fuel than ever before. Leg cramps and pain, nausea, dizziness, irritability (kept taking out/turning off my music).  It was a TERRIBLE way to end such a long training run. I had intended to continue to wrap up to 30km because the first 20ish km shaped up so well. 

I did hydrate during the run, but being a new experience I am thinking it was maybe not as much as I should have. I didn't consume too large of meal before, but nothing different than my previous standard. The only variables seem to be 1. the distance and 2. the heat. I did consume 1 small runner snack and 1 packet of gels at 11 and 18. 

Really hoping someone out there may have some great first timer experience that may help. My plan was adapted from something a local running franchise was using. The next few weeks look like this. Yesterday should have been 30km and based on my last experience I am trying to give myself some more rest then then do 25km next weekend( but will probably change this for the attempt at 30km) and 32km for the last week in September. With 24km and 16km for two weekends in October before the day. 


I keep reflecting on what caused this and want to chalk it up to  dehydration and or lack of food but not entirely sure. So I come here to ask... what could it have been? I do not refute that I very well am under-trained. However, I refuse to give this up as my injuries are for the most part, gone. Starting to become very anxious as I move closer to the date.



EDIT: Did my 30k this past Saturday. Followed normal running protocol. Hydrated above normal starting Wednesday. Started loading with carbs Thursday with diet @ 80-10-10 . Treated the training run as if I was prepping for actual marathon. Changed belt to hold 2x 10oz bottles and 1x 7oz.  (used to be 2x7oz). Brought 2 gels and 2 chew-able running snacks.  One of the 10oz bottles was Gatorade which I used at 13-18km. I also ran from 8am-11am as opposed to the mid afternoon to late afternoon heat. 

After all was said an done. I stopped twice to refill bottles. did 30 km in 3:35. Was very comfortable the entire time. No nausea, over heating, over sweating, over exhaustion, irritation etc. Any questions Id be happy to answer. 

Edit 2:
I did it. Felt great. Consuming plenty of liquids and ample food up to a week before. If any interest I will post how i dealt with 4 weeks to go and race day.

I am getting bored of the same routes, but OKC is not the type of city where you can just 'wing it' on runs. Neighborhoods jump from being nice, to sketchy real fast.

I did an out and back on a bike path here in Portland so my running mate and I decided it was best to just run the 7 miles back to the car instead of pushing to the 10 mile mark. The first couple of miles back were alright, I jogged what I could and walked as I felt my knee flaring up. The last couple of miles were a straight walk as I could tell it was getting worse.  Now a few hours later and after icing it I can hardly bend it without pain and have to straight leg it up and down the stairs at my house. I have two small children and my husband's at work so not able to completely rest off my feet but I feel like I should sit as much as possible and rest.

I'm just so torn up about it right now. I just ran Hood to Coast last weekend and was pretty lazy about getting in my weeks runs because I wanted to rest after the 48 hours of the relay. But in my runner's high from Hood to Coast my running mate talked me into running a half marathon in two weeks because our marathon plan calls for 14 miles that weekend anyways. Now I don't think I'll be able to run that (which I just paid for two nights ago) and I'm starting to doubt if I'll be healthy enough to even run the marathon.

What should I do? My goals with the marathon are just to finish, not looking to break any real times maybe just sub 5 hours really. I've just put so much into training for this.

I'm currently one month out from my first marathon. I've been running 6-7 miles 4 days per week with two long runs, the longer being on the weekend. (Mind you, I'm running this marathon for fun and to finish - not for a time.)

The humidity in Minneapolis has been insane the past couple weeks and I'm finding it impossible to finish my long runs. Today, I set out on a 12-miler (a distance I can usually run very comfortably) in 89 degree/80 dew point weather. Long story short, I was panting after a mile and a half, miserable at 2.5 miles and I threw in the towel and quit at 2.82 miles because I truly felt like I was running underwater. I caught an uber home to my non- air conditioned apartment and I've felt miserable since. Both physically and morally. I'm fairly adequately trained for this marathon but the idea that I gave up on a run in UNDER THREE MILES is completely demoralizing.  

It's been a pattern here that the disgustingly muggy days are occurring on the weekends and/or every single day of the week and it's completely hindering my ability to do long runs or sometimes even finish my short runs. I've always been more sensitive to hot weather than my peers and it's really coming through now. 

Does anyone have any advice on how to make running when it's hot and humid more bearable? Does anyone have any secret remedies? I'm open to anything at this point. 

Also - in the case that it's ultra hot and muggy outside, how bad of an idea is it to do a long run on the treadmill instead of outside? The idea of running 16 miles on the treadmill is daunting but if it's what it takes, I'll do it...

firstmarathon,"I have been training for the Twin Cities Marathon (Day of Race: October 4th) since early-to-mid July. Since then, I have been battling injuries throughout my training. Two weeks ago, I ran a 20 miler that felt good and was able to run it at a comfortable 7:30-7:45 pace. However, as the week progressed, I began experiencing a sharp, uncomfortable pain in my left foot. I tried to stick to my schedule as closely as possible, but have been very inconsistent; some days I can run 8 miles with limited pain, while I can hardly run 3 the next. I haven't gone on a long run since my 20-miler two weeks ago.

Last week, I decided to visit an athletic trainer and she determined that I had tibialis posterior tendonitis in my left foot. Along with that, she mentioned that I have a navicular drop in the same foot which has led to over-pronation. All she told me to do was ice my foot, take anti-inflamatories, and use my best judgement when running. While the pain in my foot has eased up a bit, I still have been struggling to run most days.

This injury has greatly interfered with my training and I'm worried that I will now be ill prepared for the marathon which is coming up in less than 4 weeks. 

Now that I've provided some background information, I have a few questions:

1) I was originally planning to begin to taper next week (3 weeks out). Since I haven't gone on a long run for almost two weeks and my training schedule has been inconsistent, how should I approach the next three weeks in order to be as prepared as I can be for the race?

2) I was supposed to have one of my highest mileage weeks this week. Last week, my injury prevented me from getting in the miles I was hoping for.

Anyway - my question is, what do they do after the 15 minute pace passes? Specifically, I want to know about the water/aid stations. Are they taken away?

I've completed 3 half marathons in the past 1.5 years and finished an Oly Triathlon in early August.  I immediately jumped into a marathon plan on RunKeeper.  The plan is for a 4:30 finish.  I'm currently on workout 17 of 64.  I plan to add a crossover training day on the weekend like the Higdon plans beginning next week.

Due to my trying to keep HR under control, I'm able to hit distance but not pace.   

Reviewing various HR methods, 140 seems to be where I stop being aerobic and start going anaerobic.  (http://www.digifit.com for instance)

- Today was the long run of the week - 13 miler.  Again I did the distance, but pace fell off.   Temperature was 90 today.  
- By mile 5 my HR was over 140.   I started walk-running to try to maintain a HR sub-140.  Very hard to do.
- For comparison, last week's 12 miler didn't hit 140 till mile 9. Temp was low 80's.

Questions
- Am I looking at this wrong?
- Should I change how I'm approaching this?
- Should I ditch the HR training and focus on the distance?  I am a newb after all.

I competed in the Edmonton International Marathon, a Boston qualifier, this morning.

I only started running a year ago, as part of a diet that ultimately saw me lose 50lbs. I've kept it off for 8 months now, thanks in part to running.

I didn't think seriously about racing until December, and ran my first half in February of this year. I did another one in early May. Finally I ran my first full today.

I initially had a goal of 4:30 when I started training, and over the last few weeks revised that to 5:00. I ended today in 5:20. I am excited to have finished, but feel like I could have pushed myself harder.

The first 20 kilometres went exactly as I wanted. I was a little slow for kms 18-20, but after having run two halfs, this felt really comfortable.

As I hit 20, I decided I would walk for a kilometre at 21, however by then I was running back to the start/finish area, and they announced my name as being half done, and the crowed cheered, so obviously I couldn't slow down.

I did take my walk at 22, and walked until 23.

I then ran a relatively fast 23-29, and then walked 29-30.

At 30 the mental game kicked in, and I lost. I ran to 31, stopped, had some water at an aid station, and tried to get back to running, but ultimately I spent almost 45 minutes walking to about 36. This is where I am disappointed with myself.

From 36-41 I alternated running and walking, until I hit just before 41 and ran it home, to the almost completely dwindled crowd at that point.
